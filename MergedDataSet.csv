Armani! Versace!"" at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym.

From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her.

7,The Glass Castle,The Glass Castle,,Paperback,Jeannette Walls,288,"A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.<br /><br />Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. <br /><br />Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. <br /><br />What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. <br /><br />For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.",4.26,5:368172|4:268956|3:97612|2:21917|1:9658|total:766315,737572,44111,2006,Scribner,eng,FALSE,074324754X,074324754X,80,81,7445,7445,2944133,92,074324754X,9.78074E+12,Jeannette Walls,2005,The Glass Castle,The Glass Castle,eng,4.24,621099,637866,40777,7901,18922,85191,227750,298102,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400930557m/7445.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400930557s/7445.jpg,29,The Glass Castle,074324754X,"['Jeannette Walls', 'Rex Walls', 'Rose Mary Walls', 'Maureen Walls', 'Brian Walls', '...more', 'Lori Walls', '...less']",US$ 3.80,"['New York City, New York', 'West Virginia']","['ALA Alex Award (2006)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2008)']",Jeannette Walls,10,female,"Jeannette Walls is a writer and journalist.<br /><br />Born in Phoenix, Arizona, she graduated with honors from Barnard College, the women's college affiliated with Columbia University.

Now, in Half Broke Horses, she brings us the story of her grandmother, told in a first-person voice that is authentic, irresistible, and triumphant. <br /><br />""Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did."" So begins the story of Lily Casey Smith, Jeannette Walls's no nonsense, resourceful, and spectacularly compelling grandmother. By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town -- riding five hundred miles on her pony, alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car (""I loved cars even more than I loved horses. They didn't need to be fed if they weren't working, and they didn't leave big piles of manure all over the place"") and fly a plane. And, with her husband Jim, she ran a vast ranch in Arizona. She raised two children, one of whom is Jeannette's memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle. <br /><br />Lily survived tornadoes, droughts, floods, the Great Depression, and the most heartbreaking personal tragedy. She bristled at prejudice of all kinds -- against women, Native Americans, and anyone else who didn't fit the mold. Rosemary Smith Walls always told Jeannette that she was like her grandmother, and in this true-life novel, Jeannette Walls channels that kindred spirit.

9,Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything ,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)","Freakonomics, #1",Hardcover,Steven D. Levitt,320,"Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.<br /><br />These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.<br /><br />Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.<br /><br />Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.",3.95,5:201667|4:238360|3:124954|2:28815|1:15833|total:609629,579585,12432,2006,William Morrow,eng,FALSE,61234001,61234001,91,92,1202,1202,5397,124,61234001,9.78006E+12,"Steven D.

In the cafés on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to the Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels. <br /><br />As Madeleine tries to understand why ""it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth century France,"" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead - charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy - suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old ""friend"" Mitchell Grammaticus - who's been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange - resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate. <br /><br />Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology laboratory on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret responsible for Leonard's seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love. <br /><br />Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead?

He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.<br /><br />Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br /><br />Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.",4.12,5:341139|4:260752|3:111166|2:29299|1:27147|total:769503,744466,15206,2011,Simon & Schuster,eng,FALSE,1451648537,1451648537,127,128,11084145,11084145,16005831,190,1451648537,9.78145E+12,Walter Isaacson,2011,Steve Jobs,Steve Jobs,eng,4.09,560715,579256,15198,19680,21986,88456,203975,245159,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327861368m/11084145.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327861368s/11084145.jpg,388,Steve Jobs,1451648537,['Steve Jobs'],US$ 3.76,,"['Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Shortlist (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for History & Biography (2011)', 'Premio Know Square (2011)']",Walter Isaacson,51,male,"Walter Isaacson, the CEO of the Aspen Institute, has been chairman of CNN and the managing editor of ""Time"" magazine.

21,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,,Paperback,Walter Isaacson,586,"Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.<br /><br />He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical—though not most profound—political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism.<br /><br />But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity.<br /><br />Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively.<br /><br />In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.",3.98,5:36529|4:32385|3:16312|2:4674|1:4156|total:94056,91935,1544,2004,Simon & Schuster,eng,FALSE,074325807X,074325807X,1332,1333,10883,10883,750514,30,074325807X,9.78074E+12,Walter Isaacson,2003,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,eng,3.96,70335,71804,1386,3086,3391,13181,25649,26497,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1397772877m/10883.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1397772877s/10883.jpg,797,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,074325807X,['Benjamin Franklin'],US$ 4.34,,,Walter Isaacson,51,male,"Walter Isaacson, the CEO of the Aspen Institute, has been chairman of CNN and the managing editor of ""Time"" magazine.

Relive the adventure from the beginning with this boxed set of the first three books with glorious new cover art by John Rocco.<br /><br /><em>
  <strong>The Lightning Thief</strong>
</em><br />Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. When his mom tells him the truth about where he came from, she takes him to the one place he'll be safe—Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island). There, Percy learns that the father he never knew is actually Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon Percy finds himself caught up in a mystery that could lead to disastrous consequences. Together with his friends—a satyr and another the demigod daughter of Athena—Percy sets out on a quest to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.<br /><br /><strong>
  <em>The Sea of Monsters</em>
</strong><br />After a summer spent trying to prevent a catastrophic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly calm. But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: the magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters—the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millennia—only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new name: the Bermuda Triangle. Now Percy and his friends must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclops by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. But first, Percy will learn a stunning new secret about his family—one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke…<br /><br /><strong>
  <em>The Titan's Curse</em>
</strong><br />When Percy Jackson receives a distress call from his friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle. He knows he'll need his powerful demigod allies, Annabeth and Thalia, at his side; his trusty bronze sword Riptide; and…a ride from his mom. The demigods race to the rescue, to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two new powerful half-bloods whose parentage is unknown. But that's not all that awaits them. The Titan lord, Kronos, has set up his most devious trap yet, and the young heroes have unwittingly fallen prey.

Soon Thibault experiences a sudden streak of luck—winning poker games and even surviving deadly combat that kills two of his closest buddies. Only his best friend, Victor, seems to have an explanation for his good fortune: the photograph—his lucky charm.<br />Back home in Colorado, Thibault can’t seem to get the photo—and the woman in it—out of his mind.

Caught off guard by the attraction he feels, Thibault keeps the story of the photo, and his luck, a secret.

46,Nights in Rodanthe,Nights in Rodanthe,,Paperback,Nicholas Sparks,222,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Nicholas Sparks comes a tender story of hope and joy; of sacrifice and forgiveness -- a moving reminder that love is possible at any age, at any time, and often comes when we least expect it. At forty-five, Adrienne Willis must rethink her entire life when her husband abandons her for a younger woman. Reeling with heartache and in search of a respite, she flees to the small coastal town of Rodanthe, North Carolina to tend to a friend's inn for the weekend.

47,A Bend in the Road,A Bend in the Road,,Paperback,Nicholas Sparks,341,"Miles Ryan's life seemed to end the day his wife was killed in a hit-and-run accident two years ago. Missy had been his first love, and Miles fervently believes she will be his last. As a deputy in the North Carolina town of New Bern, Miles Ryan not only grieves for Missy, but also longs to bring the unknown driver to justice. Then Miles meets Sarah Andrews. The second grade teacher of his son, Jonah, Sarah had left Baltimore after a difficult divorce to start over in the gentler surroundings of New Bern. Perhaps it's her own emotional wounds that make her sensitive to the hurt she first sees in Jonah's eyes, and then his father's. Tentatively, Sarah and Miles reach out to each other. Soon they are both laughing for the first time in years . . . and falling in love. Neither will be able to guess how closely linked they are to a shocking secret -- one that will force them to question everything they ever believed in . . . and make a heartbreaking choice that will change their lives forever.",4.03,5:48687|4:45510|3:28815|2:5949|1:1516|total:130477,122653,3138,2005,Grand Central Publishing,eng,FALSE,446696137,446696137,682,683,3463,3463,1498124,105,446696137,9.78045E+12,Nicholas Sparks,2001,A Bend in the Road,A Bend in the Road,eng,4.02,116800,123173,3392,1452,5660,27409,42912,45740,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,794,A Bend in the Road,446696137,"['Miles Ryan', 'Sarah Andrews', 'Jonah Ryan']",US$ 3.93,"['New Bern, North Carolina']",,Nicholas Sparks,110,male,"<p>Nicholas Sparks is one of the world’s most beloved storytellers.

48,The Longest Ride,The Longest Ride,,Hardcover,Nicholas Sparks,398,"Ira Levinson is in trouble. At ninety-one years old, in poor health and alone in the world, he finds himself stranded on an isolated embankment after a car crash. Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together – how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can’t possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage.<br /><br />A few miles away, at a local rodeo, a Wake Forest College senior’s life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward -- even life and death – loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans -- a future that Luke has the power to rewrite . . . if the secret he’s keeping doesn’t destroy it first.<br /><br />Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience. Yet their lives will converge with unexpected poignancy, reminding us all that even the most difficult decisions can yield extraordinary journeys: beyond despair, beyond death, to the farthest reaches of the human heart.",4.14,5:42725|4:35615|3:17170|2:3846|1:1190|total:100546,80275,7746,2013,Grand Central Publishing,eng,FALSE,1455520659,1455520659,1097,1098,17407748,17407748,24248331,92,1455520659,9.78146E+12,Nicholas Sparks,2012,The Longest Ride,The Longest Ride,eng,4.14,71276,88683,8692,1011,3435,15361,31569,37307,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1367536453m/17407748.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1367536453s/17407748.jpg,1229,The Longest Ride,1455520659,"['Ruth', 'Ira Levinson', 'Sophia Danko', 'Luke Collins']",US$ 3.54,,"['Audie Award for Romance (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Romance (2013)']",Nicholas Sparks,110,male,"<p>Nicholas Sparks is one of the world’s most beloved storytellers.

Never again will you think about thinking the same way.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? <br /><br />In <i>Blink</i> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",3.91,5:130373|4:160765|3:95907|2:22711|1:8213|total:417969,402722,12160,2007,Back Bay Books,eng,FALSE,316010669,316010669,210,211,40102,40102,1180927,116,316010669,9.78032E+12,Malcolm Gladwell,2005,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,en-US,3.89,348196,360338,12215,6804,20128,85934,139947,107525,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,80,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,316010669,,US$ 3.47,,,Malcolm Gladwell,49,male,"Malcolm Gladwell is a United Kingdom-born, Canadian-raised journalist now based in New York City.

They were young and in love, with a perfect little house and not a care in the world. Then they brought home Marley, a wiggly yellow furball of a puppy. Life would never be the same.<br /><br />Marley quickly grew into a barreling, ninety-seven-pound streamroller of a Labrador retriever, a dog like no other. He crashed through screen doors, gouged through drywall, flung drool on guests, stole women's undergarments, and ate nearly everything he could get his mouth around, including couches and fine jewelry. Obedience school did no good—Marley was expelled. Neither did the tranquilizers the veterinarian prescribed for him with the admonishment, ""Don't hesitate to use these.""<br /><br />And yet Marley's heart was pure. Just as he joyfully refused any limits on his behavior, his love and loyalty were boundless, too. Marley shared the couple's joy at their first pregnancy, and their heartbreak over the miscarriage. He was there when babies finally arrived and when the screams of a seventeen-year-old stabbing victim pierced the night. Marley shut down a public beach and managed to land a role in a feature-length movie, always winning hearts as he made a mess of things. Through it all, he remained steadfast, a model of devotion, even when his family was at its wit's end.

Henry Perowne is a contented man — a successful neurosurgeon, happily married to a newspaper lawyer, and enjoying good relations with his children. Henry wakes to the comfort of his large home in central London on this, his day off. He is as at ease here as he is in the operating room. Outside the hospital, the world is not so easy or predictable. There is an impending war against Iraq, and a general darkening and gathering pessimism since the New York and Washington attacks two years before.<br /><br />On this particular Saturday morning, Perowne's day moves through the ordinary to the extraordinary. After an unusual sighting in the early morning sky, he makes his way to his regular squash game with his anaesthetist, trying to avoid the hundreds of thousands of marchers filling the streets of London, protesting against the war. A minor accident in his car brings him into a confrontation with a small-time thug.

The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his ""World's Fair Hotel"" just west of the fairgrounds—a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.<br /><br />The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B.

Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.<p>A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany, she has one affair after another, including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.</p><p>Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming—yet wholly sinister—Goebbels, <em>In the Garden of Beasts</em> lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity.

68,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,,Hardcover,Erik Larson,430,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the Lusitania<br /><br />On May 1, 1915, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone, and for months, its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era's great transatlantic ""Greyhounds"" and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew, moreover, that his ship - the fastest then in service - could outrun any threat. <br /><br />Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small - hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. <br /><br />It is a story that many of us think we know but don't, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour, mystery, and real-life suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster that helped place America on the road to war.",4.08,5:30759|4:39841|3:14856|2:2586|1:1160|total:89202,74605,9031,2015,Crown Publishers,eng,FALSE,307408868,307408868,1325,1326,22551730,22551730,42009388,46,307408868,9.78031E+12,Erik Larson,2015,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,eng,4.07,61439,73006,8719,1070,2171,12326,32604,24835,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408923747m/22551730.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408923747s/22551730.jpg,1467,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,307408868,,US$ 4.04,,"['Washington State Book Award for Nonfiction (2016)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for History & Biography (2015)']",Erik Larson,9,male,"Erik Larson, author of the international bestseller <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239186.Isaac_s_Storm_A_Man__a_Time__and_the_Deadliest_Hurricane_in_History"" title=""Isaac's Storm A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History by Erik Larson"" rel=""nofollow"">Isaac's Storm</a>, was nominated for a National Book Award for <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21996.The_Devil_in_the_White_City_Murder__Magic__and_Madness_at_the_Fair_that_Changed_America"" title=""The Devil in the White City Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America by Erik Larson"" rel=""nofollow"">The Devil in the White City</a>, which also won an Edgar Award for fact-crime writing.

72,Dry,Dry,,Paperback,Augusten Burroughs,293,"Revisit the second memoir in Augusten's bestselling trilogy of <i>Running with Scissors, Dry,</i> and <i>Lust &amp; Wonder</i>. <br /><br />You may not know it, but you've met Augusten Burroughs. You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twenty-something guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls, and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten landed in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey, Jr., are immediately dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click, and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is real. <i>Dry</i> is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a higher power.",4.02,5:27212|4:30113|3:16901|2:3243|1:757|total:78226,74339,3041,2004,Picador USA,eng,FALSE,312423799,312423799,1101,1102,32370,32370,1825967,40,312423799,9.78031E+12,Augusten Burroughs,2003,Dry: A Memoir,Dry,eng,4.01,70550,73886,3148,728,3150,16092,28576,25340,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,353,Dry,312423799,,US$ 3.73,,['Randy Shilts Award Nominee (2004)'],Augusten Burroughs,14,male,"Augusten Burroughs born Christopher Robison, son of poet and writer <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/912036.Margaret_Robison"" rel=""nofollow"">Margaret Robison</a> and younger brother of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/183819.John_Elder_Robison"" rel=""nofollow"">John Elder Robison</a>.<br /><br />Burroughs has no formal education beyond elementary school.

75,A Wolf at the Table,A Wolf at the Table,,Hardcover,Augusten Burroughs,242,"“As a little boy, I had a dream that my father had taken me to the woods where there was a dead body. He buried it and told me I must never tell. It was the only thing we’d ever done together as father and son, and I promised not to tell. But unlike most dreams, the memory of this one never left me. And sometimes…I wasn’t altogether sure about one thing: was it just a dream?”<i></i><br /><br />When Augusten Burroughs was small, his father was a shadowy presence in his life: a form on the stairs, a cough from the basement, a silent figure smoking a cigarette in the dark. As Augusten grew older, something sinister within his father began to unfurl.  Something dark and secretive that could not be named. <br /><br />Betrayal after shocking betrayal ensued, and Augusten’s childhood was over. The kind of father he wanted didn’t exist for him. This father was distant, aloof, uninterested…<br /><br />And then the “games” began.<br /><br />With ""A Wolf at the Table"", Augusten Burroughs makes a quantum leap into untapped emotional terrain: the radical pendulum swing between love and hate, the unspeakably terrifying relationship between father and son. Told with scorching honesty and penetrating insight, it is a story for anyone who has ever longed for unconditional love from a parent. Though harrowing and brutal, ""A Wolf at the Table"" will ultimately leave you buoyed with the profound joy of simply being alive. It’s a memoir of stunning psychological cruelty and the redemptive power of hope.<br /><br />",3.72,5:6387|4:8599|3:7033|2:2153|1:702|total:24874,23370,1817,2008,St. Martin's Press,eng,FALSE,312342020,312342020,4136,4137,2145681,2145681,2216670,31,312342020,9.78031E+12,Augusten Burroughs,2008,A Wolf at the Table,A Wolf at the Table,eng,3.7,22175,23524,1876,672,2072,6735,8114,5931,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1159,A Wolf at the Table,312342020,,US$ 3.58,,,Augusten Burroughs,14,male,"Augusten Burroughs born Christopher Robison, son of poet and writer <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/912036.Margaret_Robison"" rel=""nofollow"">Margaret Robison</a> and younger brother of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/183819.John_Elder_Robison"" rel=""nofollow"">John Elder Robison</a>.<br /><br />Burroughs has no formal education beyond elementary school.

76,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,,Hardcover,Max Brooks,342,"The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<br /><br />Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.<br /><br />Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""<br /><br />Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.",4.01,5:145132|4:134271|3:72506|2:21886|1:8492|total:382287,344669,19960,2006,Crown,eng,FALSE,307346609,307346609,238,239,8908,8908,817,137,307346609,9.78031E+12,Max Brooks,2006,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,en-US,4.01,312969,345149,22412,7680,19887,65570,121537,130475,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386328204m/8908.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386328204s/8908.jpg,128,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,307346609,"['Zombies', 'Kwang Jing-shu', 'Nury Televaldi', 'Stanley MacDonald', 'Todd Wainio', '...more', 'Maria Zhuganova', 'Jesika Hendricks', 'Joe Muhammad', '...less']",US$ 4.04,,"['Audie Award for Multi-Voiced Performance (2014)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2012)']",Max Brooks,36,Unknown,"Max Brooks is The New York Times bestselling author of The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z.

To console his only child, Daniel’s widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona’s guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel’s father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax’s work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona’s darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn’t find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.<br /><br />As with all astounding novels, The Shadow of the Wind sends the mind groping for comparisons—The Crimson Petal and the White? The novels of Arturo Pérez-Reverte? Of Victor Hugo? Love in the Time of Cholera?—but in the end, as with all astounding novels, no comparison can suffice. As one leading Spanish reviewer wrote, ""The originality of Ruiz Zafón’s voice is bombproof and displays a diabolical talent. The Shadow of the Wind announces a phenomenon in Spanish literature.""

Casting aside his love of elaborate character and town histories and penchant for delayed gratification, King yanks readers off their feet within the first few pages; dragging them into the fray and offering no chance catch their breath until the very last page. <p> In <i>Cell</i> King taps into readers fears of technological warfare and terrorism. Mobile phones deliver the apocalypse to millions of unsuspecting humans by wiping their brains of any humanity, leaving only aggressive and destructive impulses behind. Those without cell phones, like illustrator Clayton Riddell and his small band of ""normies,"" must fight for survival, and their journey to find Clayton's estranged wife and young son rockets the book toward resolution. </p><p> Fans that have followed King from the beginning will recognize and appreciate <i>Cell</i> as a departure--King's writing has not been so pure of heart and free of hang-ups in years (wrapping up his phenomenal Dark Tower series and receiving a medal from the National Book Foundation doesn't hurt either).

In a high-suspense race against time, three of the most unlikely heroes Stephen King has ever created try to stop a lone killer from blowing up thousands. “<i>Mr. Mercedes</i> is a rich, resonant, exceptionally readable accomplishment by a man who can write in whatever genre he chooses” (<i>The Washington Post</i>).<br /><br />In the frigid pre-dawn hours, in a distressed Midwestern city, desperate unemployed folks are lined up for a spot at a job fair. Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes.<br /><br /> In another part of town, months later, a retired cop named Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved crime. When he gets a crazed letter from someone who self-identifies as the “perk” and threatens an even more diabolical attack, Hodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing another tragedy.<br /><br /> Brady Hartsfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again. Only Bill Hodges, with two new, unusual allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again. And they have no time to lose, because Brady’s next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim thousands.<br /><br /><i>Mr. Mercedes</i> is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable.",3.95,5:58920|4:77251|3:39609|2:8736|1:3799|total:188315,158371,12037,2014,Scribner,eng,FALSE,1476754454,1476754454,622,623,18775247,18775247,26680281,111,1476754454,9.78148E+12,Stephen King,2014,Mr. Mercedes,"Mr. Mercedes (Bill Hodges Trilogy, #1)",eng,3.92,125847,148491,12447,3242,7332,32479,60965,44473,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468705326m/18775247.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468705326s/18775247.jpg,1434,"Mr. Mercedes (Bill Hodges Trilogy, #1)",1476754454,"['Bill Hodges', 'Jerome Robinson', 'Brady Hartsfield', 'Janey Trelawney', 'Holly Gibney']",US$ 4.53,['Midwest'],"['Hammett Prize (2014)', 'Edgar Award for Best Novel (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Mystery & Thriller (2014)']",Stephen King,1596,male,"Stephen Edwin King was born the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King.

99,Revival,Revival,,Hardcover,Stephen King,405,"In a small New England town, in the early 60s, a shadow falls over a small boy playing with his toy soldiers. Jamie Morton looks up to see a striking man, the new minister. Charles Jacobs, along with his beautiful wife, will transform the local church. The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs Jacobs; the women and girls – including Jamie’s mother and beloved sister – feel the same about Reverend Jacobs. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond, based on their fascination with simple experiments in electricity.<br /><br />Then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family; the preacher curses God, mocking all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town.<br /><br />Jamie has demons of his own. In his mid-thirties, he is living a nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll. Addicted to heroin, stranded, desperate, he sees Jacobs again – a showman on stage, creating dazzling ‘portraits in lightning’ – and their meeting has profound consequences for both men. Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil’s devising, and Jamie discovers that <i>revival</i> has many meanings.

A HORIZON LINE, MAYBE, BUT ALSO A SLOT FOR BLACKNESS TO POUR THROUGH . . . <br /><br />A terrible construction site accident takes Edgar Freemantle's right arm and scrambles his memory and his mind, leaving him with little but rage as he begins the ordeal of rehabilitation. A marriage that produced two lovely daughters suddenly ends, and Edgar begins to wish he hadn't survived the injuries that could have killed him. He wants out. His psychologist, Dr. Kamen, suggests a ""geographic cure,"" a new life distant from the Twin Cities and the building business Edgar grew from scratch.

The sun setting into the Gulf of Mexico and the tidal rattling of shells on the beach call out to him, and Edgar draws. A visit from Ilse, the daughter he dotes on, starts his movement out of solitude. He meets a kindred spirit in Wireman, a man reluctant to reveal his own wounds, and then Elizabeth Eastlake, a sick old woman whose roots are tangled deep in Duma Key. Now Edgar paints, sometimes feverishly, his exploding talent both a wonder and a weapon. Many of his paintings have a power that cannot be controlled. When Elizabeth's past unfolds and the ghosts of her childhood begin to appear, the damage of which they are capable is truly devastating.<br /><br />The tenacity of love, the perils of creativity, the mysteries of memory and the nature of the supernatural--Stephen King gives us a novel as fascinating as it is gripping and terrifying.",3.94,5:29117|4:33679|3:20229|2:5103|1:1383|total:89511,82231,4087,2008,,eng,FALSE,1416552510,1416552510,1359,1360,472343,472343,3041864,105,1416552510,9.78142E+12,Stephen King,2008,Duma Key,Duma Key,en-US,3.93,73807,79596,4435,1249,4629,18274,30121,25323,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1470266968m/472343.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1470266968s/472343.jpg,491,Duma Key,1416552510,"['Edgar Freemantle', 'Jerome Wireman', 'Elizabeth Eastlake', 'Dr. Xander Kamen', 'Jack Cantori', '...more', 'Perse', 'Candy Brown', 'Mary Ire', 'Pam Freemantle', 'Ilse Freemantle', '...less']",US$ 1.00,"['Florida', 'Minnesota']","['Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel (2008)', 'Audie Award for Fiction (2009)']",Stephen King,1596,male,"Stephen Edwin King was born the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King.

105,Just After Sunset,Just After Sunset,,,Stephen King,539,"STEPHEN KING--who has written more than fifty books, dozens of number one New York Times best-sellers, and many unforgettable movies--delivers an astonishing collection of short stories, his first since Everything's Eventual six years ago. As guest editor of the bestselling Best American Short Stories 2007, King spent over a year reading hundreds of stories. His renewed passion for the form is evident on every page of Just After Sunset. The stories in this collection have appeared in The New Yorker, Playboy, McSweeney's, The Paris Review, Esquire, and other publications.<br /><br /> Who but Stephen King would turn a Port-O-San into a slimy birth canal, or a roadside honky-tonk into a place for endless love? A book salesman with a grievance might pick up a mute hitchhiker, not knowing the silent man in the passenger seat listens altogether too well. Or an exercise routine on a stationary bicycle, begun to reduce bad cholesterol, might take its rider on a captivating--and then terrifying--journey. Set on a remote key in Florida, ""The Gingerbread Girl"" is a riveting tale featuring a young woman as vulnerable--and resourceful--as Audrey Hepburn's character in Wait Until Dark. In ""Ayana,"" a blind girl works a miracle with a kiss and the touch of her hand. For King, the line between the living and the dead is often blurry, and the seams that hold our reality intact might tear apart at any moment. In one of the longer stories here, ""N.,"" which recently broke new ground when it was adapted as a graphic digital entertainment, a psychiatric patient's irrational thinking might create an apocalyptic threat in the Maine countryside . . . or keep the world from falling victim to it.<br /><br /> Just After Sunset--call it dusk, call it twilight, it's a time when human intercourse takes on an unnatural cast, when nothing is quite as it appears, when the imagination begins to reach for shadows as they dissipate to darkness and living daylight can be scared right out of you. It's the perfect time for Stephen King.<br />(jacket)<br /><br />Willa --<br />The gingerbread girl --<br />Harvey's dream --<br />Rest stop --<br />Stationary bike --<br />The things they left behind --<br />Graduation afternoon --<br />N. --<br />The cat from hell --<br />The New York Times at special bargain rates --<br />Mute --<br />Ayana --<br />A very tight place.",3.87,5:11478|4:17094|3:11788|2:2090|1:411|total:42861,38419,1841,,,eng,FALSE,1416584080,1416584080,2978,2979,2906039,2906039,2927243,79,1416584080,9.78142E+12,Stephen King,2008,Just After Sunset,Just After Sunset,eng,3.85,34722,38319,2133,361,1925,10705,15299,10029,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,619,Just After Sunset,1416584080,,US$ 1.00,['United States of America'],"['Bram Stoker Award for Best Fiction Collection (2008)', 'Shirley Jackson Award Nominee for Single-Author Collection (Finalist) (2008)', 'ALA Alex Award (2009)', 'British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Collection (2009)']",Stephen King,1596,male,"Stephen Edwin King was born the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King.

106,The Bazaar of Bad Dreams,The Bazaar of Bad Dreams,,Hardcover,Stephen King,495,"A master storyteller at his best—the O. Henry Prize winner Stephen King delivers a generous collection of stories, several of them brand-new, featuring revelatory autobiographical comments on when, why, and how he came to write (or rewrite) each story.<br /><br />Since his first collection, Nightshift, published thirty-five years ago, Stephen King has dazzled readers with his genius as a writer of short fiction. In this new collection he assembles, for the first time, recent stories that have never been published in a book. He introduces each with a passage about its origins or his motivations for writing it.<br /><br />There are thrilling connections between stories; themes of morality, the afterlife, guilt, what we would do differently if we could see into the future or correct the mistakes of the past. “Afterlife” is about a man who died of colon cancer and keeps reliving the same life, repeating his mistakes over and over again. Several stories feature characters at the end of life, revisiting their crimes and misdemeanors. Other stories address what happens when someone discovers that he has supernatural powers—the columnist who kills people by writing their obituaries in “Obits;” the old judge in “The Dune” who, as a boy, canoed to a deserted island and saw names written in the sand, the names of people who then died in freak accidents. In “Morality,” King looks at how a marriage and two lives fall apart after the wife and husband enter into what seems, at first, a devil’s pact they can win.<br /><br />Magnificent, eerie, utterly compelling, these stories comprise one of King’s finest gifts to his constant reader—“I made them especially for you,” says King. “Feel free to examine them, but please be careful. The best of them have teeth.”",3.92,5:10414|4:16379|3:8758|2:1566|1:471|total:37588,28075,3173,2015,Scribner,eng,FALSE,1501111671,1501111671,3755,3756,23512999,23512999,43116154,54,1501111671,9.7815E+12,Stephen King,2015,The Bazaar of Bad Dreams,The Bazaar of Bad Dreams,eng,3.92,22054,28439,3384,395,1213,6521,12347,7963,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468705688m/23512999.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468705688s/23512999.jpg,4024,The Bazaar of Bad Dreams,1501111671,,US$ 4.47,,['Shirley Jackson Award for Single Author Collection (2015)'],Stephen King,1596,male,"Stephen Edwin King was born the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King.

In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five....In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge. <br /><br />Sterling is a small, ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens -- until the day its complacency is shattered by a shocking act of violence. In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families. <br /><br />Nineteen Minutes is New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you?

She works through the night, preparing the day’s breads and pastries, trying to escape a reality of loneliness, bad memories, and the shadow of her mother’s death. When Josef Weber, an elderly man in Sage’s grief support group, begins stopping by the bakery, they strike up an unlikely friendship.

But he has a special focus on one subject - forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him in to crime scenes, and he's always showing up and telling the cops what to do. And he's usually right.<br /><br />But when Jacob's small hometown is rocked by a terrible murder, law enforcement comes to him. Jacob's behaviors are hallmark Asperger's, but they look a lot like guilt to the local police. Suddenly the Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are directly in the spotlight. For Jacob's mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it's another indication why nothing is normal because of Jacob.<br /><br />And over this small family, the soul-searing question looms: <i>

Every expectant parent will tell you that they don't want a perfect baby, just a healthy one. Charlotte and Sean O'Keefe would have asked for a healthy baby, too, if they'd been given the choice. Instead, their lives are made up of sleepless nights, mounting bills, the pitying stares of ""luckier"" parents, and maybe worst of all, the what-ifs. What if their child had been born healthy?

Addie, desperate for answers, must look into her heart -- and into Jack's lies and shadowy secrets -- for evidence that will condemn or redeem the man she has come to love.<br /><br />When Jack St. Bride arrives by chance in the sleepy New England town of Salem Falls, he decides to reinvent himself. Tall, blond, and handsome, Jack was once a beloved teacher and soccer coach at a girls' prep school -- until a student's crush sparked a powder keg of accusation and robbed him of his reputation. Now, working for minimum wage washing dishes for Addie Peabody at the Do-Or-Diner, Jack buries his past, content to become the mysterious stranger who has appeared out of the blue. <br /><br />With ghosts of her own haunting her, Addie Peabody is as cautious around men as Jack St. Bride is around women. But as this unassuming stranger steps smoothly into the diner's daily routine, she finds him fitting just as comfortably inside her heart -- and slowly, a gentle, healing love takes hold between them. <br /><br />Yet planting roots in Salem Falls may prove fateful for Jack. Amid the white-painted centuries-old churches, a quartet of bored, privileged teenage girls have formed a coven that is crossing the line between amusement and malicious intent. Quick to notice the attractive new employee at Addie's diner, the girls turn Jack's world upside down with a shattering allegation that causes history to repeat itself -- and forces Jack to proclaim his innocence once again. Suddenly nothing in Salem Falls is as it seems: a safe haven turns dangerous, an innocent girl meets evil face-to-face, a dishwasher with a Ph.D. is revealed to be an ex-con. As Jack's hidden past catches up with him, the seams of this tiny town begin to tear, and the emerging truth becomes a slippery concept written in shades of gray. Now Addie, desperate for answers, must look into her heart -- and into Jack's lies and shadowy secrets -- for evidence that will condemn or redeem the man she has come to love.",3.81,5:16861|4:26597|3:19087|2:4042|1:865|total:67452,64410,2936,2002,Washington Square Press,eng,FALSE,743418719,743418719,1684,1685,10915,10915,3349637,55,743418719,9.78074E+12,Jodi Picoult,2001,Salem Falls,Salem Falls,en-US,3.8,59930,62434,2992,816,3815,17863,24523,15417,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344397557m/10915.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344397557s/10915.jpg,920,Salem Falls,743418719,"['Jack St. Bride', 'Addie Peabody', 'Gillian Duncan', 'Jordan McAfee', 'Matt Houlihan', '...more', 'Amos Duncan', 'Meg Saxton', 'Chelsea Abrams', 'Charlie Saxton', ""Whitney O'Neill"", '...less']",US$ 3.58,"['Salem Falls, New Hampshire']",,Jodi Picoult,66,female,"Jodi Picoult is the author of twenty-four novels, including the #1 New York Times bestsellers Small Great Things, Leaving Time, The Storyteller, Lone Wolf, Between the Lines, Sing You Home, House Rules, Handle with Care, Change of Heart, Nineteen Minutes, and My Sister’s Keeper.

When odd, supernatural events plague the town of Comtosook, a ghost hunter is hired by the developer to help convince the residents that there's nothing spiritual about the property. <br /><br />Enter Ross Wakeman, a suicidal drifter who has put himself in mortal danger time and again. He's driven his car off a bridge into a lake. He's been mugged in New York City and struck by lightning in a calm country field. Yet despite his best efforts, life clings to him and pulls him ever deeper into the empty existence he cannot bear since his fiancée's death in a car crash eight years ago. Ross now lives only for the moment he might once again encounter the woman he loves. But in Comtosook, the only discovery Ross can lay claim to is that of Lia Beaumont, a skittish, mysterious woman who, like Ross, is on a search for something beyond the boundary separating life and death. Thus begins Jodi Picoult's enthralling and ultimately astonishing story of love, fate, and a crime of passion. <br /><br />Hailed by critics as a ""master"" storyteller (Washington Post), Picoult once again ""pushes herself, and consequently the reader, to think about the unthinkable"" (Denver Post). Second Glance, her eeriest and most engrossing work yet, delves into a virtually unknown chapter of American history -- Vermont's eugenics project of the 1920s and 30s -- to provide a compelling study of the things that come back to haunt us -- literally and figuratively.

None of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in 1st to Die, although the female protagonists offer an even deeper emotional context to this suspense thriller.<br /><br />Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department suddenly finds herself in the middle of two horrifying situations: The first is that she's just learned she has an often-fatal blood disease. The second is a double homicide case she is now heading up that involves the murder of newlyweds on their wedding night. Burdened with Chris Raleigh, a new partner reassigned from the mayor's office, Lindsay finds that she has too much to deal with and turns to her best friend, Claire, the head ME on the case. Claire offers helpful advice and human, friendly contact amid a job filled with violence, cruelty, and fear.<br /><br />Soon a fledgling newspaper reporter, Cindy, makes contact with Lindsay looking for a career-making story. Although Lindsay can't officially comment on the case, the two women form a rapport, and Cindy joins Lindsay and Claire for their weekly meeting. When a second pair of newlyweds is murdered, and later a third, the investigation leads to a prominent crime writer, Nicholas Jenks, who has a history of spousal abuse and a predilection for kinky, dangerous sex games. With the help of an understanding assistant D.A., Jill Bernhardt, Lindsay tries to make a case against Jenks, who even had an affair with one of the slain women. Eventually Jill joins the Murder Club, and the four ladies share private interdepartmental information in an effort to track and stop the killer before he strikes again.<br /><br />The major subplot -- Lindsay's facing up to her illness even while she learns to fall in love again -- carefully compensates for the novel's coarse scenes of brutality. Lindsay Boxer is't merely an obsessed cop trailing a maniac; she's also a terrified woman confronting the onslaught of disease. The story lines balance out to show us the true mettle of someone who puts the safety of others before her own.<br /><br />Again, Patterson's skill for producing furiously paced fiction are evident as the novel breezes by rapidly. The short chapters keep the narrative leaping with increasingly taut plot elements, but there's an emotional commitment that makes our protagonist even more amiable and involving. 1st to Die is a novel that works as an intense series of character portraits that will leave the reader touched and delighted.<br /><br />--Tom Piccirilli",4.07,5:107385|4:91473|3:52112|2:10930|1:4937|total:266837,255376,4891,2005,Grand Central Publishing,eng,FALSE,446696617,446696617,335,336,13137,13137,1711194,107,446696617,9.78045E+12,James Patterson,2001,1st To Die,"1st to Die (Women's Murder Club, #1)",en-US,4.05,233984,242428,5039,4464,10087,48616,83796,95465,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,514,"1st to Die (Women's Murder Club, #1)",446696617,"['Lindsay Boxer', 'Claire Washburn', 'Jill Bernhardt', 'Cindy Thomas', 'Warren Jacobi']",US$ 3.96,"['San Francisco, California']",,James Patterson,603,male,"<a href=""http://www.jamespatterson.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Official US Site</a><br /><a href=""http://www.jamespatterson.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Official UK Site</a><br /><a href=""http://jimmypatterson.org"" rel=""nofollow"">JIMMY Patterson Books</a><br /><a href=""http://readkiddoread.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ReadKiddoRead</a><br /><br /><br /><br />James Patterson is the world’s bestselling author and most trusted storyteller. He has created more enduring fictional characters than any other novelist writing today, with his Alex Cross, Michael Bennett, Women’s Murder Club, Private, NYPD Red, Daniel X, Maximum Ride, and Middle School series. He has sold over 380 million books worldwide and currently holds the Guinness World Record for the most #1 New York Times bestsellers. In addition to writing the thriller novels for which he is best known, among them The President Is Missing with President Bill Clinton, Patterson also writes fiction for young readers of all ages, including the Max Einstein series, produced in partnership with the Albert Einstein Estate. He is also the first author to have #1 new titles simultaneously on the New York Times adult and children’s bestseller lists.<br /><br />The son of an insurance salesman and a schoolteacher, Patterson grew up in Newburgh, New York, and began casually writing at the age of nineteen. In 1969, he graduated from Manhattan College. He was given a full-ride scholarship to Vanderbilt University’s graduate program in English. He left Vanderbilt before getting his PhD due to complications involving the Vietnam War. <br /><br />Instead, he moved to New York to become a junior copywriter for the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, eventually becoming CEO of its North American company.<br /><br />In 1976, while still working for J. Walter Thompson, Patterson published his first novel, The Thomas Berryman Number, with Little, Brown and Company.

  <b>Detective Alex Cross must confront his most terrifying nemesis ever-and his own deepest fears-in this electrifying new thriller from the master of suspense, James Patterson.</b>
</blockquote>Alex Cross has never believed in vampires. But when two joggers are found slain in a manner that suggests a macabre ritual, he has to reconsider. Someone believes in vampires enough to have committed a series of bizarre murders that appear to be the work of one. Local police are horrified, and even the FBI is baffled.<p>Cross takes on the case and plunges into a netherworld of secret clubs and role-players, a world full of poseurs and playactors-and someone demented enough to have crossed the line from dark ritual to real blood. At the same time, a lethal super-criminal from Cross's past known as the Mastermind is stalking him, taunting him, and threatening everything he holds dear. Cross has never been closer to defeat, or in greater danger. In a shocking conclusion, Alex Cross must survive a deadly confrontation-only to discover at last the awful secret of the Mastermind.</p>",3.96,5:14734|4:19139|3:11810|2:1888|1:434|total:48005,44387,928,2002,Grand Central Publishing,eng,FALSE,446611212,446611212,2546,2547,79379,79379,1827952,76,446611212,9.78045E+12,James Patterson,2001,Violets Are Blue,"Violets Are Blue (Alex Cross, #7)",eng,3.94,41555,44214,940,400,1758,11115,17683,13258,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,3007,"Violets Are Blue (Alex Cross, #7)",446611212,"['Alex Cross', 'Kyle Craig', 'Jamilla ""Jam"" Hughes', 'Kate McTiernan']",US$ 3.47,"['Washington, D.C.', 'San Francisco, California', 'New Orleans, Louisiana']",,James Patterson,603,male,"<a href=""http://www.jamespatterson.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Official US Site</a><br /><a href=""http://www.jamespatterson.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Official UK Site</a><br /><a href=""http://jimmypatterson.org"" rel=""nofollow"">JIMMY Patterson Books</a><br /><a href=""http://readkiddoread.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ReadKiddoRead</a><br /><br /><br /><br />James Patterson is the world’s bestselling author and most trusted storyteller.

But they do try to communicate, with a short-order cook in a small desert town serving as their reluctant confidant. Odd Thomas thinks of himself as an ordinary guy, if possessed of a certain measure of talent at the Pico Mundo Grill and rapturously in love with the most beautiful girl in the world, Stormy Llewellyn.<br /><br />Maybe he has a gift, maybe it's a curse, Odd has never been sure, but he tries to do his best by the silent souls who seek him out. Sometimes they want justice, and Odd's otherworldly tips to Pico Mundo's sympathetic police chief, Wyatt Porter, can solve a crime. Occasionally they can prevent one. But this time it's different.<br /><br />A mysterious man comes to town with a voracious appetite, a filing cabinet stuffed with information on the world's worst killers, and a pack of hyena-like shades following him wherever he goes. Who the man is and what he wants, not even Odd's deceased informants can tell him. His most ominous clue is a page ripped from a day-by-day calendar for August 15.<br /><br />Today is August 14.<br /><br />In less than twenty-four hours, Pico Mundo will awaken to a day of catastrophe. As evil coils under the searing desert sun, Odd travels through the shifting prisms of his world, struggling to avert a looming cataclysm with the aid of his soul mate and an unlikely community of allies that includes the King of Rock 'n' Roll.

145,Velocity,Velocity,,Mass Market Paperback,Dean Koontz,460,"Dean Koontz's unique talent for writing terrifying thrillers with a heart and soul is nowhere more evident than in this latest suspense masterpiece that pits one man against the ultimate deadline. If there were speed limits for the sheer pulse-racing excitement allowed in one novel, ""Velocity"" would break them all. Get ready for the ride of your life. <br /><br />Bill Wiles is an easygoing, hardworking guy who leads a quiet, ordinary life. But that is about to change. One evening, after his usual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note under the windshield wiper of his car. <br /><br /><blockquote>
  <i>""If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher. If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work. You have four hours to decide. The choice is yours.""</i>
</blockquote><br /><br />It seems like a sick joke, and Bill's friend on the police force, Lanny Olson, thinks so too. His advice to Bill is to go home and forget about it. Besides, what could they do even if they took the note seriously? No crime has actually been committed. But less than twenty-four hours later, a young blond schoolteacher is found murdered, and it's Bill's fault: he didn't convince the police to get involved. Now he's got another note, another deadline, another ultimatum...and two new lives hanging in the balance. <br /><br />Suddenly Bill's average, seemingly innocuous life takes on the dimensions and speed of an accelerating nightmare. Because the notes are coming faster, the deadlines growing tighter, and the killer becoming bolder and crueler with every communication--until Bill is isolated with the terrifying knowledge that he alone has the power of life and death over a psychopath's innocent victims. Until the struggle between good and evil is intensely personal. Until the most chilling words of all are: <i>""The choice is yours.""</i>",3.86,5:15482|4:20177|3:14720|2:3036|1:799|total:54214,51356,1457,2006,Bantam,eng,FALSE,553588257,553588257,1921,1922,32421,32421,1167068,60,553588257,9.78055E+12,Dean Koontz,2005,Velocity,Velocity,eng,3.85,48755,51074,1542,751,2861,13997,18945,14520,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,3153,Velocity,553588257,,US$ 3.99,,['ITW Thriller Award Nominee for Best Novel (2006)'],Dean Koontz,433,Unknown,"Acknowledged as ""America's most popular suspense novelist"" (Rolling Stone) and as one of today's most celebrated and successful writers, Dean Ray Koontz has earned the devotion of millions of readers around the world and the praise of critics everywhere for tales of character, mystery, and adventure that strike to the core of what it means to be human.<br /><br />Dean R.

The silent spirits of the dead who visited him in his earlier life are mercifully absent, save for the bell-ringing Brother Constantine and Odd’s steady companion, the King of Rock 'n' Roll.<br /><br />But trouble has a way of finding Odd Thomas, and it slinks back onto his path in the form of the sinister bodachs he has met previously, the black shades who herald death and disaster, and who come late one December night to hover above the abbey’s most precious charges.

So long as he is ready. So long as he is, above all, afraid.<br /><br />Jimmy Tock comes into the world on the very night his grandfather leaves it. As a violent storm rages outside the hospital, Rudy Tock spends long hours walking the corridors between the expectant fathers' waiting room and his dying father's bedside. It's a strange vigil made all the stranger when, at the very height of the storm's fury, Josef Tock suddenly sits up in bed and speaks coherently for the first and last time since his stroke.<br /><br />What he says before he dies is that there will be five dark days in the life of his grandson – five dates whose terrible events Jimmy will have to prepare himself to face. The first is to occur in his 20th year; the second in his 23rd year; the third in his 28th; the fourth in his 29th; the fifth in his 30th.<br /><br />Rudy is all too ready to discount his father's last words as a dying man's delusional rambling. But then he discovers that Josef also predicted the moment of his grandson's birth to the minute, as well as his exact height, weight, and the fact that Jimmy would be born with syndactyly – the unexplained anomaly of fused digits on his left foot. Suddenly, the old man's predictions take on a chilling significance.<br /><br />What terrifying events await Jimmy on these five dark days? What nightmares will he face? What challenges must he survive? As the novel unfolds, picking up Jimmy's story at each of these crisis points, the path he must follow will defy every expectation. And with each crisis he faces, he will move closer to a fate he could never have imagined.

149,By the Light of the Moon,By the Light of the Moon,,Mass Market Paperback,Dean Koontz,460,"Dean Koontz has surpassed his longtime reputation as “America’s most popular suspense novelist”(<i>Rolling Stone</i>) to become one of the most celebrated and successful writers of our time. Reviewers hail his boundless originality, his art, his unparalleled ability to create highly textured, riveting drama, at once viscerally familiar and utterly unique. <br /><br />Author of one <i>#1 New York Times</i> bestseller after another, Koontz is at the pinnacle of his powers, spinning mysteries and miracles, enthralling tales that speak directly to today’s readers, balm for the heart and fire for the mind. In this stunning new novel, he delivers a tour de force of dark suspense and brilliant revelation that has all the Koontz trademarks: adventure, chills, riddles, humor, heartbreak, an unforgettable cast of characters, and a climax that will leave you clamoring for more.<br /><br />Dylan O’Connor is a gifted young artist just trying to do the right thing in life. He’s on his way to an arts festival in Santa Fe when he stops to get a room for himself and his twenty-year-old autistic brother, Shep. But in a nightmarish instant, Dylan is attacked by a mysterious “doctor,” injected with a strange substance, and told that he is now a carrier of something that will either kill him...or transform his life in the most remarkable way. Then he is told that he must flee--before the doctor’s enemies hunt him down for the secret circulating through his body. No one can help him, the doctor says, not even the police.<br /><br />Stunned, disbelieving, Dylan is turned loose to run for his life...and straight into an adventure that will turn the next twenty-four hours into an odyssey of terror, mystery--and wondrous discovery. It is a journey that begins when Dylan and Shep’s path intersects with that of Jillian Jackson. Before that evening Jilly was a beautiful comedian whose biggest worry was whether she would ever find a decent man. Now she too is a carrier. And even as Dylan tries to convince her that they’ll be safer sticking together, cold-eyed men in a threatening pack of black Suburbans approach, only seconds before Jilly’s classic Coupe DeVille explodes into thin air. <br /><br />Now the three are on the run together, but with no idea whom they’re running from--or why. Meanwhile Shep has begun exhibiting increasingly disturbing behavior. And whatever it is that’s coursing through their bodies seems to have plunged them into one waking nightmare after another. Seized by sinister premonitions, they find themselves inexplicably drawn to crime scenes--just minutes before the crimes take place. <br /><br />What this unfathomable power is, how they can use it to stop the evil erupting all around them, and why they have been chosen are only parts of a puzzle that reaches back into the tragic past and the dark secrets they all share: secrets of madness, pain, and untimely death. Perhaps the answer lies in the eerie, enigmatic messages that Shep, with precious time running out, begins to repeat, about an entity who does his work “by the light of the moon.”<br /><br /><b>By the Light of the Moon</b> is a novel of heart-stopping suspense and transcendent beauty, of how evil can destroy us and love can redeem us--a masterwork of the imagination in which the surprises come page after page and the spell of sublime storytelling triumphs throughout.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.85,5:6036|4:8096|3:6049|2:1165|1:275|total:21621,20483,624,2007,Bantam,,FALSE,553582763,553582763,5506,5507,15752,15752,1177628,44,553582763,9.78055E+12,Dean Koontz,2002,By the Light of the Moon,By the Light of the Moon,,3.84,19276,20189,643,264,1118,5698,7569,5540,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,4036,By the Light of the Moon,553582763,"[""Dylan O'Connor"", ""Shep O'Connor"", 'Jillian Jackson']",US$ 3.99,,,Dean Koontz,433,Unknown,"Acknowledged as ""America's most popular suspense novelist"" (Rolling Stone) and as one of today's most celebrated and successful writers, Dean Ray Koontz has earned the devotion of millions of readers around the world and the praise of critics everywhere for tales of character, mystery, and adventure that strike to the core of what it means to be human.<br /><br />Dean R.

He goes on vacation with his family. He gets a job selling drinks. He attends his brother's wedding. He mops his sister's floor. He gives directions to a lost traveler. He eats a hamburger.

To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b><i> </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.

They are where history ends up.”<br /><br />Bill Bryson and his family live in a Victorian parsonage in a part of England where nothing of any great significance has happened since the Romans decamped. Yet one day, he began to consider how very little he knew about the ordinary things of life as he found it in that comfortable home. To remedy this, he formed the idea of journeying about his house from room to room to “write a history of the world without leaving home.” The bathroom provides the occasion for a history of hygiene; the bedroom, sex, death, and sleep; the kitchen, nutrition and the spice trade; and so on, as Bryson shows how each has figured in the evolution of private life.

154,The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid,The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid,,Hardcover,Bill Bryson,288,"<b>From one of the most beloved and bestselling authors in the English language, a vivid, nostalgic, and utterly hilarious memoir of growing up in the 1950s<br /></b><br />Bill Bryson was born in the middle of the American century—1951—in the middle of the United States—Des Moines, Iowa—in the middle of the largest generation in American history—the baby boomers. As one of the best and funniest writers alive, he is perfectly positioned to mine his memories of a totally all-American childhood for 24-carat memoir gold. Like millions of his generational peers, Bill Bryson grew up with a rich fantasy life as a superhero. In his case, he ran around his house and neighborhood with an old football jersey with a thunderbolt on it and a towel about his neck that served as his cape, leaping tall buildings in a single bound and vanquishing awful evildoers (and morons)—in his head—as ""The Thunderbolt Kid."" <br /><br />Using this persona as a springboard, Bill Bryson re-creates the life of his family and his native city in the 1950s in all its transcendent normality—a life at once completely familiar to us all and as far away and unreachable as another galaxy. It was, he reminds us, a happy time, when automobiles and televisions and appliances (not to mention nuclear weapons) grew larger and more numerous with each passing year, and DDT, cigarettes, and the fallout from atmospheric testing were considered harmless or even good for you. He brings us into the life of his loving but eccentric family, including affectionate portraits of his father, a gifted sportswriter for the local paper and dedicated practitioner of isometric exercises, and OF his mother, whose job as the home furnishing editor for the same paper left her little time for practicing the domestic arts at home. The many readers of Bill Bryson’s earlier classic, <i>A Walk in the Woods,</i> will greet the reappearance in these pages of the immortal Stephen Katz, seen hijacking literally boxcar loads of beer. He is joined in the Bryson gallery of immortal characters by the demonically clever Willoughby brothers, who apply their scientific skills and can-do attitude to gleefully destructive ends. <br /><br />Warm and laugh-out-loud funny, and full of his inimitable, pitch-perfect observations, <i>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</i> is as wondrous a book as Bill Bryson has ever written. It will enchant anyone who has ever been young.",3.94,5:16059|4:19726|3:11636|2:2554|1:765|total:50740,46037,3672,2006,Broadway Books,,FALSE,076791936X,076791936X,2249,2250,10538,10538,2252299,63,076791936X,9.78077E+12,Bill Bryson,2006,The Life and Times of The Thunderbolt Kid: A Memoir,The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid,,3.93,42680,46658,4015,709,2386,10824,18212,14527,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1958,The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid,076791936X,,US$ 3.91,['United States of America'],,Bill Bryson,73,male,"William McGuire ""Bill"" Bryson, OBE, FRS was born in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1951.

155,"One Summer: America, 1927","One Summer: America, 1927",,Hardcover,Bill Bryson,456,"In <i>One Summer</i> Bill Bryson, one of our greatest and most beloved nonfiction writers, transports readers on a journey back to one amazing season in American life.<br /><br />The summer of 1927 began with one of the signature events of the twentieth century: on May 21, 1927, Charles Lindbergh became the first man to cross the Atlantic by plane nonstop, and when he landed in Le Bourget airfield near Paris, he ignited an explosion of worldwide rapture and instantly became the most famous person on the planet. Meanwhile, the titanically talented Babe Ruth was beginning his assault on the home run record, which would culminate on September 30 with his sixtieth blast, one of the most resonant and durable records in sports history. In between those dates a Queens housewife named Ruth Snyder and her corset-salesman lover garroted her husband, leading to a murder trial that became a huge tabloid sensation. Alvin “Shipwreck” Kelly sat atop a flagpole in Newark, New Jersey, for twelve days—a new record. The American South was clobbered by unprecedented rain and by flooding of the Mississippi basin, a great human disaster, the relief efforts for which were guided by the uncannily able and insufferably pompous Herbert Hoover. Calvin Coolidge interrupted an already leisurely presidency for an even more relaxing three-month vacation in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The gangster Al Capone tightened his grip on the illegal booze business through a gaudy and murderous reign of terror and municipal corruption. The first true “talking picture,” Al Jolson’s <i>The Jazz Singer</i>, was filmed and forever changed the motion picture industry. The four most powerful central bankers on earth met in secret session on a Long Island estate and made a fateful decision that virtually guaranteed a future crash and depression.<br />     All this and much, much more transpired in that epochal summer of 1927, and Bill Bryson captures its outsized personalities, exciting events, and occasional just plain weirdness with his trademark vividness, eye for telling detail, and delicious humor. In that year America stepped out onto the world stage as the main event, and <i>One Summer</i> transforms it all into narrative nonfiction of the highest order.",4.08,5:13608|4:16041|3:6308|2:1256|1:600|total:37813,31295,3769,2013,Doubleday,eng,FALSE,767919408,767919408,3134,3135,17262366,17262366,23859166,41,767919408,9.78077E+12,Bill Bryson,2013,One Summer: America 1927,"One Summer: America, 1927",eng,4.06,27237,32545,4011,565,1114,5500,13918,11448,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1380292864m/17262366.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1380292864s/17262366.jpg,2380,"One Summer: America, 1927",767919408,"['Charles Lindbergh', 'Babe Ruth', 'Al Jolson', 'Herbert Hoover', 'Al Capone', '...more', 'Lou Gehrig', 'Philo Farnsworth', 'Gene Tunney', 'Jack Dempsey', 'Calvin Coolidge', '...less']",US$ 1.00,['United States of America'],['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2013)'],Bill Bryson,73,male,"William McGuire ""Bill"" Bryson, OBE, FRS was born in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1951.

157,The Namesake,The Namesake,,Paperback,Jhumpa Lahiri,291,"Jhumpa Lahiri's <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i> established this young writer as one the most brilliant of her generation. Her stories are one of the very few debut works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New Yorker Debut of the Year award, the PEN/Hemingway Award, and the highest critical praise for its grace, acuity, and compassion in detailing lives transported from India to America.<br /><br />In <i>The Namesake</i>, Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail — the fleeting moment, the turn of phrase — that opens whole worlds of emotion.<br /><br /><i>The Namesake</i> takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. <br /><br />Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves.",3.98,5:65179|4:88070|3:45426|2:9383|1:2048|total:210106,199697,9782,2004,Mariner Books,eng,FALSE,618485228,618485228,377,378,33917,33917,16171,93,618485228,9.78062E+12,Jhumpa Lahiri,2003,The Namesake,The Namesake,en-US,3.96,184211,192903,9824,1926,8889,42552,81043,58493,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480106986m/33917.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480106986s/33917.jpg,63,The Namesake,618485228,"['Ashoke Ganguli', 'Ashima Ganguli', 'Gogol/Nikhil Ganguli', 'Sonia/Sonali Ganguli', 'Maxine', '...more', 'Moushumi Mazoomdar', '...less']",US$ 3.57,,['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2004)'],Jhumpa Lahiri,53,female,"Nilanjana Sudeshna ""Jhumpa"" Lahiri was born in London and brought up in South Kingstown, Rhode Island.

In the suburban streets of Calcutta where they wandered before dusk and in the hyacinth-strewn ponds where they played for hours on end, Udayan was always in his older brother's sight.

He will give everything, risk all, for what he believes, and in doing so will transform the futures of those dearest to him: his newly married, pregnant wife, his brother and their parents.

But he’s harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he’s keeping all to himself. In “A Choice of Accommodations,” a husband’s attempt to turn an old friend’s wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In “Only Goodness,” a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in “Hema and Kaushik,” a trio of linked stories—a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate—we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts. They travel from innocence to experience on separate, sometimes painful paths, until destiny brings them together again years later in Rome. <br /><br />Unaccustomed Earth is rich with Jhumpa Lahiri’s signature gifts: exquisite prose, emotional wisdom, and subtle renderings of the most intricate workings of the heart and mind.

162,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,,Paperback,Eric Schlosser,399,"A groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.<br /><br />Are we what we eat? To a degree both engrossing and alarming, the story of fast food is the story of postwar America. Though created by a handful of mavericks, the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad. <br /><br />That's a lengthy list of charges, but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning. Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold America's most dangerous job -- meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers' convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations. <br /><br />Along the way, Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains' efforts to reel in the youngest, most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization -- a phenomenon launched by fast food. Fast Food Nation is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.",3.74,5:48903|4:72102|3:49451|2:12617|1:8049|total:191122,186575,4892,2005,Harper Perennial,eng,FALSE,60838582,60838582,397,398,1097,1097,2207547,61,60838582,9.78006E+12,Eric Schlosser,2001,Fast Food Nation : The Dark Side of the All-American Meal ,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,eng,3.73,179347,183361,5063,7881,12314,47602,69009,46555,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,168,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,60838582,,US$ 3.85,"['Colorado Springs, Colorado']",['Puddly Award for Nonfiction (2003)'],Eric Schlosser,20,male,"Eric Schlosser is an award-winning American journalist and author known for investigative journalism.

Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.",4.14,5:98429|4:92542|3:37405|2:9265|1:3274|total:240915,200687,11079,2006,Vintage International,eng,FALSE,1400079276,1400079276,429,430,4929,4929,6191072,157,1400079276,9.7814E+12,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",2002,海辺のカフカ [Umibe no Kafuka],Kafka on the Shore,en-US,4.13,167593,195365,13279,2593,7557,30809,75564,78842,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,43,Kafka on the Shore,1400079276,"['Kafka Tamura', 'Sakura', 'Satoru Nakata', 'Oshima', 'Miss Saeki', '...more', 'Hoshino', '...less']",US$ 2.95,['Takamatsu'],"['World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (2006)', 'Independent Foreign Fiction Prize Nominee for Longlist (2006)', 'PEN Translation Prize for Philip Gabriel (2006)', 'Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis Nominee for Preis der Jugendjury (2005)', 'Tähtifantasia Award (2010)', 'Βραβείο Βιβλίου Public for Μεταφρασμένο μυθιστόρημα της χρονιάς (Translator: Αργυρώ Μαντόγλου) (2016)']",Haruki Murakami,382,male,"<b>Murakami</b> Haruki (Japanese: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11882216"" rel=""nofollow"">村上 春樹</a>) is a popular contemporary Japanese writer and translator.

167,What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,,Hardcover,Haruki Murakami,188,"In 1982, having sold his jazz bar to devote himself to writing, Murakami began running to keep fit. A year later, he'd completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, not to mention triathlons and a dozen critically acclaimed books, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and--even more important--on his writing. Equal parts training log, travelogue, and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and takes us to places ranging from Tokyo's Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston among young women who outpace him. Through this marvelous lens of sport emerges a panorama of memories and insights: the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer, his greatest triumphs and disappointments, his passion for vintage LPs, and the experience, after fifty, of seeing his race times improve and then fall back. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is rich and revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in distance running.""",3.82,5:19918|4:32887|3:21753|2:4701|1:974|total:80233,61946,5409,2008,Knopf Publishing Group,eng,FALSE,307269191,307269191,1612,1613,2195464,2195464,2475030,120,307269191,9.78031E+12,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",2007,走ることについて語るときに僕の語ること [Hashiru koto ni tsuite kataru toki ni boku no kataru koto],What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,eng,3.79,49344,61740,6144,820,3864,17403,25073,14580,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1473397159m/2195464.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1473397159s/2195464.jpg,4189,What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,307269191,,US$ 1.98,,,Haruki Murakami,382,male,"<b>Murakami</b> Haruki (Japanese: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11882216"" rel=""nofollow"">村上 春樹</a>) is a popular contemporary Japanese writer and translator.

The Grimke’s daughter, Sarah, has known from an early age she is meant to do something large in the world, but she is hemmed in by the limits imposed on women.<br /><br />Kidd’s sweeping novel is set in motion on Sarah’s eleventh birthday, when she is given ownership of ten year old Handful, who is to be her handmaid. We follow their remarkable journeys over the next thirty five years, as both strive for a life of their own, dramatically shaping each other’s destinies and forming a complex relationship marked by guilt, defiance, estrangement and the uneasy ways of love.<br /><br />As the stories build to a riveting climax, Handful will endure loss and sorrow, finding courage and a sense of self in the process. Sarah will experience crushed hopes, betrayal, unrequited love, and ostracism before leaving Charleston to find her place alongside her fearless younger sister, Angelina, as one of the early pioneers in the abolition and women’s rights movements.<br /><br />Inspired by the historical figure of Sarah Grimke, Kidd goes beyond the record to flesh out the rich interior lives of all of her characters, both real and invented, including Handful’s cunning mother, Charlotte, who courts danger in her search for something better.<br /><br />This exquisitely written novel is a triumph of storytelling that looks with unswerving eyes at a devastating wound in American history, through women whose struggles for liberation, empowerment, and expression will leave no reader unmoved.",4.23,5:98066|4:93578|3:29817|2:4820|1:1833|total:228114,196121,19077,2014,Viking,eng,FALSE,670024783,670024783,436,437,18079776,18079776,25387072,63,670024783,9.78067E+12,Sue Monk Kidd,2014,The Invention of Wings,The Invention of Wings,en-US,4.23,168006,193774,19518,1466,4021,25745,80524,82018,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386699861m/18079776.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386699861s/18079776.jpg,420,The Invention of Wings,670024783,"['Hetty ""Handful” Grimke', 'Sarah Moore Grimké', 'Charlotte Grimke', 'Angelina Grimké']",US$ 3.63,"['Charleston, South Carolina']","['Florida Book Award for General Fiction - Gold (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2014)', 'International DUBLIN Literary Award Nominee (2016)']",Sue Monk Kidd,27,female,"<br /><b>SUE MONK KIDD</b> was raised in the small town of Sylvester, Georgia.

185,The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution,The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution,,Hardcover,Richard Dawkins,470,"Charles Darwin’s masterpiece, <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, shook society to its core on publication in 1859. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke but he would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians, yet millions of people continue to question its veracity.<br /><br />In <i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i> Richard Dawkins takes on creationists, including followers of ‘Intelligent Design’ and all those who question the fact of evolution through natural selection. Like a detective arriving on the scene of a crime, he sifts through fascinating layers of scientific facts and disciplines to build a cast-iron case: from the living examples of natural selection in birds and insects; the ‘time clocks’ of trees and radioactive dating that calibrate a timescale for evolution; the fossil record and the traces of our earliest ancestors; to confirmation from molecular biology and genetics. All of this, and much more, bears witness to the truth of evolution.<br /><br /><i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i> comes at a critical time: systematic opposition to the fact of evolution is now flourishing as never before, especially in America. In Britain and elsewhere in the world, teachers witness insidious attempts to undermine the status of science in their classrooms. Richard Dawkins provides unequivocal evidence that boldly and comprehensively rebuts such nonsense. At the same time he shares with us his palpable love of the natural world and the essential role that science plays in its interpretation. Written with elegance, wit and passion, it is hard-hitting, absorbing and totally convincing.",4.17,5:18703|4:15663|3:5836|2:1280|1:1089|total:42571,38884,1447,2009,Bantam Press,eng,FALSE,059306173X,059306173X,2502,2503,6117055,6117055,6295163,55,059306173X,9.78059E+12,Richard Dawkins,2009,The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution,The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution,en-GB,4.16,34088,37106,1620,872,1112,5169,13850,16103,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1302127919m/6117055.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1302127919s/6117055.jpg,1263,The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution,059306173X,,US$ 1.84,,['Prismas Casa de las Ciencias a la Divulgación for Libro editado (2010)'],Richard Dawkins,87,male,,Unknown,Alive,Unknown

Loosely based on the form of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dawkins's Tale takes us modern humans back through four billion years of life on our planet. As the pilgrimage progresses, we join with other organisms at the forty ""rendezvous points"" where we find a common ancestor. The band of pilgrims swells into a vast crowd as we join first with other primates, then with other mammals, and so on back to the first primordial organism.<br /><br />Dawkins's brilliant, inventive approach allows us to view the connections between ourselves and all other life in a bracingly novel way. It also lets him shed bright new light on the most compelling aspects of evolutionary history and theory: sexual selection, speciation, convergent evolution, extinction, genetics, plate tectonics, geographical dispersal, and more. The Ancestor's Tale is at once a far-reaching survey of the latest, best thinking on biology and a fascinating history of life on Earth. Here Dawkins shows us how remarkable we are, how astonishing our history, and how intimate our relationship with the rest of the living world.",4.13,5:8584|4:6452|3:2798|2:742|1:583|total:19159,18091,577,2005,Mariner Books,eng,FALSE,061861916X,061861916X,5257,5258,17977,17977,3135643,37,061861916X,9.78062E+12,Richard Dawkins,2004,The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution,The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution,en-US,4.13,16775,17617,606,542,667,2645,5946,7817,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1269,The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution,061861916X,,US$ 4.04,,['Royal Society Science Book Prize Nominee for General Prize (2005)'],Richard Dawkins,87,male,,Unknown,Alive,Unknown

In 2004, Chuck began submitting essays to ChuckPalahniuk.net on the craft of writing. These were 'How To' pieces, straight out of Chuck's personal bag of tricks, based on the tenants of minimalism he learned from Tom Spanbauer. Every month, a “Homework Assignment” would accompany the lesson, so Workshop members could apply what they had learned. (all 36 of these essays can currently be found on The Cult's sister-site, LitReactor.com).<br /><br />Then, in 2009, Chuck increased his involvement by committing to read and review a selection of fan-written stories each month. The best stories are currently set to be published in <i>Burnt Tongues</i>, a forthcoming anthology, with an introduction written by Chuck himself. <br /><br />His next novel, <i>Beautiful You</i>, is due out in October 2014.<br />",Unknown,Alive,5

199,The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World,The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World,,Paperback,Michael Pollan,297,"Working in his garden one day, Michael Pollan hit pay dirt in the form of an idea: do plants, he wondered, use humans as much as we use them? While the question is not entirely original, the way Pollan examines this complex coevolution by looking at the natural world from the perspective of plants is unique. The result is a fascinating and engaging look at the true nature of domestication.<p> In making his point, Pollan focuses on the relationship between humans and four specific plants: apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. He uses the history of John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) to illustrate how both the apple's sweetness and its role in the production of alcoholic cider made it appealing to settlers moving west, thus greatly expanding the plant's range. He also explains how human manipulation of the plant has weakened it, so that ""modern apples require more pesticide than any other food crop."" The tulipomania of 17th-century Holland is a backdrop for his examination of the role the tulip's beauty played in wildly influencing human behavior to both the benefit and detriment of the plant (the markings that made the tulip so attractive to the Dutch were actually caused by a virus). His excellent discussion of the potato combines a history of the plant with a prime example of how biotechnology is changing our relationship to nature. As part of his research, Pollan visited the Monsanto company headquarters and planted some of their NewLeaf brand potatoes in his garden--seeds that had been genetically engineered to produce their own insecticide. Though they worked as advertised, he made some startling discoveries, primarily that the NewLeaf plants themselves are registered as a pesticide by the EPA and that federal law prohibits anyone from reaping more than one crop per seed packet. And in a interesting aside, he explains how a global desire for consistently perfect French fries contributes to both damaging monoculture and the genetic engineering necessary to support it.</p><p> Pollan has read widely on the subject and elegantly combines literary, historical, philosophical, and scientific references with engaging anecdotes, giving readers much to ponder while weeding their gardens. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>",4.06,5:15043|4:16703|3:7833|2:1651|1:477|total:41707,39323,2771,2002,Random House Trade Paperbacks,eng,FALSE,375760393,375760393,2356,2357,13839,13839,908398,32,375760393,9.78038E+12,Michael Pollan,2001,The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World,The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World,en-CA,4.05,37200,38145,2753,445,1529,7265,15258,13648,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,538,The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World,375760393,,US$ 4.04,,['Borders Original Voices Award for Nonfiction (2001)'],Michael Pollan,47,Unknown,"<b>Michael Pollan</b> is an American author, journalist, activist, and professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, where he is also the director of the Knight Program in Science and Environmental Journalism.<br /><br /><i>Excerpted from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>.</i>",Unknown,Alive,Unknown

Job loss has forced them to live in their car, leaving them vulnerable to roving gangs. They desperately need to turn their situation around - and fast. The Positron Project in the town of Consilience seems to be the answer to their prayers. No one is unemployed and everyone gets a comfortable, clean house to live in... for six months out of the year. On alternating months, residents of Consilience must leave their homes and function as inmates in the Positron prison system. Once their month of service in the prison is completed, they can return to their ""civilian"" homes. <br /><br />At first, this doesn't seem like too much of a sacrifice to make in order to have a roof over one's head and food to eat. But when Charmaine becomes romantically involved with the man who lives in their house during the months when she and Stan are in the prison, a series of troubling events unfolds, putting Stan's life in danger.

204,The Penelopiad,The Penelopiad,,Hardcover,Margaret Atwood,198,"<b>Now that all the others have run out of air, it’s my turn to do a little story-making.</b> <p>In Homer’s account in <i>The Odyssey</i>, Penelope—wife of Odysseus and cousin of the beautiful Helen of Troy—is portrayed as the quintessential faithful wife, her story a salutary lesson through the ages. Left alone for twenty years when Odysseus goes off to fight in the Trojan War after the abduction of Helen, Penelope manages, in the face of scandalous rumors, to maintain the kingdom of Ithaca, bring up her wayward son, and keep over a hundred suitors at bay, simultaneously. When Odysseus finally comes home after enduring hardships, overcoming monsters, and sleeping with goddesses, he kills her suitors and—curiously—twelve of her maids.</p> <p>In a splendid contemporary twist to the ancient story, Margaret Atwood has chosen to give the telling of it to Penelope and to her twelve hanged maids, asking: “What led to the hanging of the maids, and what was Penelope <i>really</i> up to?” In Atwood’s dazzling, playful retelling, the story becomes as wise and compassionate as it is haunting, and as wildly entertaining as it is disturbing. With wit and verve, drawing on the story-telling and poetic talent for which she herself is renowned, she gives Penelope new life and reality—and sets out to provide an answer to an ancient mystery.</p>",3.69,5:6809|4:12097|3:9817|2:2680|1:522|total:31925,25877,2325,2005,Canongate U.S.,eng,FALSE,1841957178,1841957178,5394,5395,17645,17645,3016476,77,1841957178,9.78184E+12,Margaret Atwood,2005,The Penelopiad,The Penelopiad,en-US,3.66,21731,25698,2512,464,2307,8074,9567,5286,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,2424,The Penelopiad,1841957178,"['Odysseus', 'Penelope (wife of Odysseus)']",US$ 8.94,,['Mythopoeic Fantasy Award Nominee for Adult Literature (2006)'],Margaret Atwood,344,female,"Margaret Atwood was born in 1939 in Ottawa and grew up in northern Ontario, Quebec, and Toronto.

With powerful and swift, prose, <i>Flight</i> follows this troubled foster teenager--a boy who is not a ""legal"" Indian because he was never claimed by his father--as he learns that violence is not the answer.<br /><br />The journey for <i>Flight</i>'s young hero begins as he's about to commit a massive act o violence. At the moment of decision, he finds himself shot back through time to resurface in the body of an FBI agent during the civil rights era, where he sees why ""Hell is Re driver, Idaho, in the 1970s."" Red River is only the first stop in an eye-opening trip through moments in American history. He will continue traveling back to inhabit the body of an Indian child during the battle at Little Bighorn and then ride with an Indian tracker in the nineteenth century before materializing as an airline pilot jetting through the skies today. During these furious travels through time, his refrain grows: ""Who's to judge?"" and ""I don't understand humans."" When finally, blessedly, our young warrior comes to rest again in his own life, he is mightily transformed by all he has seen.<br /><br />This is Sherman Alexie at his most brilliant--making us laugh while he's breaking our hearts. <i>Time Out</i> has said that ""Alexie, like his characters, is on a modern-day vision quest,"" and in <i>Flight</i> he seeks nothing less than an understanding of why human beings hate. <i>Flight</i> is irrepressible, fearless, and groundbreaking Alexie.",3.89,5:4043|4:5677|3:3480|2:751|1:220|total:14171,13585,1966,2007,Grove Atlantic Black Cat,eng,FALSE,802170374,802170374,8388,8389,52872,52872,1094776,20,802170374,9.7808E+12,Sherman Alexie,2007,Flight: A Novel,Flight,en-US,3.89,12016,12429,1894,188,652,3064,4976,3549,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1918,Flight,802170374,,US$ 3.47,,,Sherman Alexie,101,male,"Sherman J.

213,Pirate Latitudes,Pirate Latitudes,,Hardcover,Michael Crichton,312,"Jamaica in 1665 is a rough outpost of the English crown, a minor colony holding out against the vast supremacy of the Spanish empire. Port Royal, Jamaica′s capital, a cut-throat town of taverns, grog shops, and bawdy houses, is devoid of London′s luxuries; life here can end swiftly with dysentery or a dagger in your back. But for Captain Charles Hunter it is a life that can also lead to riches, if he abides by the island′s code. In the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England, gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking. And law in the New World is made by those who take it into their hands.<br /><br />Word in port is that the Spanish treasure galleon El Trinidad, fresh from New Spain, is stalled in nearby Matanceros harbor awaiting repairs. Heavily fortified, the impregnable Spanish outpost is guarded by the blood-swiller Cazalla, a favorite commander of King Philip IV himself. With the governor′s backing, Hunter assembles a roughneck crew to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon, along with its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloody legends of Matanceros suggest, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he finds himself on the island′s shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry are all that stand between him and the treasure.<br /><br />With the help of his cunning crew, Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly clutches of Cazalla, leaving plenty of carnage in his wake.

214,Freedom,Freedom,,Hardcover,Jonathan Franzen,562,"Patty and Walter Berglund were the new pioneers of old St. Paul—the gentrifiers, the hands-on parents, the avant-garde of the Whole Foods generation. Patty was the ideal sort of neighbor, who could tell you where to recycle your batteries and how to get the local cops to actually do their job. She was an enviably perfect mother and the wife of Walter's dreams. Together with Walter—environmental lawyer, commuter cyclist, total family man—she was doing her small part to build a better world.<br /><br />But now, in the new millennium, the Berglunds have become a mystery. Why has their teenage son moved in with the aggressively Republican family next door? Why has Walter taken a job working with Big Coal? What exactly is Richard Katz—outré rocker and Walter's college best friend and rival—still doing in the picture? Most of all, what has happened to Patty? Why has the bright star of Barrier Street become ""a very different kind of neighbor,"" an implacable Fury coming unhinged before the street's attentive eyes?<br /><br />In his first novel since <i>The Corrections</i>, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.<br />(jacket)",3.74,5:38916|4:51598|3:31439|2:12319|1:6375|total:140647,127154,11997,2010,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",eng,FALSE,374158460,374158460,653,654,7905092,7905092,9585796,92,374158460,9.78037E+12,Jonathan Franzen,2010,Freedom,Freedom,en-US,3.73,119213,130682,12909,6143,11728,29502,47828,35481,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316729686m/7905092.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316729686s/7905092.jpg,116,Freedom,374158460,"['Walter Berglund', 'Patty Berglund', 'Joey Berglund', 'Jessica Berglund', 'Richard Katz']",US$ 3.58,,"['Warwick Prize for Writing Nominee for Longlist (2013)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2010)', 'Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Fiction (2011)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (2010)', 'Bad Sex in Fiction Award Nominee (2010)', 'John Gardner Book Award for Fiction (2011)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Favorite Book, Fiction (2010)']",Jonathan Franzen,53,male,"Jonathan Franzen is the author of <i>The Corrections</i>, winner of the 2001 National Book Award for fiction; the novels The <i>Twenty-Seventh City</i> and <i>Strong Motion</i>; and two works of nonfiction, <i>How to Be Alone</i> and <i>The Discomfort Zone</i>, all published by FSG.

Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With <i>The Corrections</i>, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.<br /><br />Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says.<br /><br />Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a ""transgressive"" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.<br /><br />Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband's growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline, the Lamberts must face the failures, secrets, and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.<br /></div>",3.79,5:44246|4:50674|3:29473|2:11814|1:7170|total:143377,127394,7251,2002,Fourth Estate Paperbacks,eng,FALSE,1841156736,1841156736,657,658,3805,3805,941200,133,1841156736,9.78184E+12,Jonathan Franzen,2001,The Corrections,The Corrections,eng,3.78,117657,131271,8201,6684,10960,27173,46440,40014,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355011305m/3805.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355011305s/3805.jpg,50,The Corrections,1841156736,"['Alfred Lambert', 'Enid Lambert', 'Gary Lambert']",US$ 4.04,"['St. Jude, Illinois']","['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for Fiction (2002)', 'National Book Award for Fiction (2001)', 'James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction (2002)', 'PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction Nominee (2002)', 'Audie Award for Fiction, Abridged (2002)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (2001)', 'International DUBLIN Literary Award Nominee (2003)']",Jonathan Franzen,53,male,"Jonathan Franzen is the author of <i>The Corrections</i>, winner of the 2001 National Book Award for fiction; the novels The <i>Twenty-Seventh City</i> and <i>Strong Motion</i>; and two works of nonfiction, <i>How to Be Alone</i> and <i>The Discomfort Zone</i>, all published by FSG.

216,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,,Paperback,Susanna Clarke,1006,"Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England. She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that eight hundred pages leave readers longing for more.<br /><br />English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.<br /><br />But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.<br /><br />All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.",3.82,5:60123|4:54402|3:34466|2:15401|1:8765|total:173157,149003,9011,2006,Tor Books,eng,FALSE,765356155,765356155,681,682,14201,14201,3921305,124,765356155,9.78077E+12,Susanna Clarke,2004,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,eng,3.8,133683,154688,11516,8086,14044,30972,48696,52890,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1357027589m/14201.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1357027589s/14201.jpg,69,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,765356155,"['Napoleon Bonaparte', 'Jonathan Strange', 'Gilbert Norrell', 'George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron', 'John Uskglass (The Raven King)', '...more', 'John Childermass', 'Vinculus', 'Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool', 'Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington', 'Stephen Black', 'John Segundus', 'Mr. Honeyfoot', 'Mrs. Honeyfoot', 'Christopher Drawlight', 'Henry Lascelles', 'Jeremy Johns', 'Arabella Woodhope Strange', 'Laurence Strange', 'Sir Walter Pole', 'Lady Emma Wintertowne Pole', 'Henry Woodhope', 'John Hyde', 'Dr. Lancelot Greysteel', 'Louisa Greysteel', 'Flora Greysteel', 'Mrs Delgado', '...less']",US$ 1.00,['United Kingdom'],"['Hugo Award for Best Novel (2005)', 'Man Booker Prize Nominee for Longlist (2004)', 'Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (2005)', 'Locus Award for Best First Novel and Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2005)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2004)', 'World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (2005)', 'Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature (2005)', 'Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction (2005)', 'British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (2005)', 'Cena Akademie SFFH for Kniha roku (Book of the Year) (2007)']",Susanna Clarke,24,female,"Susanna Clarke was born in Nottingham in 1959.

This is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In Under The Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.<br /><br />Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives,"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.<br /><br />Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.",3.99,5:45002|4:57857|3:27532|2:5821|1:2237|total:138449,124949,8084,2004,Pan MacMillan,eng,FALSE,330419129,330419129,687,688,10847,10847,1723947,37,330419129,9.78033E+12,Jon Krakauer,2003,Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,eng,3.98,112167,123697,8947,1958,5259,25101,52050,39329,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356441391m/10847.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356441391s/10847.jpg,102,Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,330419129,,US$ 4.54,['Utah'],['Colorado Book Award for General Nonfiction (2004)'],Jon Krakauer,36,male,"Jon Krakauer is an American writer and mountaineer, well-known for outdoor and mountain-climbing writing.<br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/jonkrakauer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/jonkrakauer</a>",Unknown,Alive,Unknown

In this odyssey of self-discovery, Maria has to choose between pursuing a path of darkness—sexual pleasure for its own sake—or risking everything to find her own “inner light” and the possibility of sacred sex, sex in the context of love.",3.69,5:34771|4:43716|3:35311|2:12620|1:4973|total:131391,113393,4673,2003,HarperOne,eng,FALSE,60589280,60589280,707,708,1430,1430,1950213,194,60589280,9.78006E+12,"Paulo Coelho, Margaret Jull Costa",2003,Onze minutos,Eleven Minutes,eng,3.69,102206,116141,5444,4444,11306,31202,38487,30702,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358266987m/1430.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358266987s/1430.jpg,1491,Eleven Minutes,60589280,"['Mariecke', 'Ralph']",US$ 3.60,['Geneva'],,Paulo Coelho,164,male,"The Brazilian author PAULO COELHO was born in 1947 in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

239,Great House,Great House,,Hardcover,Nicole Krauss,289,"For twenty-five years, a reclusive American novelist has been writing at the desk she inherited from a young Chilean poet who disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police, one day a girl claiming to be the poet's daughter arrives to take it away, sending the writer's life reeling. Across the ocean, in the leafy suburbs of London, a man caring for his dying wife discovers, among her papers, a lock of hair that unravels a terrible secret. In Jerusalem, an antiques dealer slowly reassembles his father's study, plundered by the Nazis in Budapest in 1944.<br /><br />Connecting these stories is a desk of many drawers that exerts a power over those who possess it or have given it away. As the narrators of Great House make their confessions, the desk takes on more and more meaning, and comes finally to stand for all that has been taken from them, and all that binds them to what has disappeared.<br /><br />Great House is a story haunted by questions: What do we pass on to our children and how do they absorb our dreams and losses? How do we respond to disappearance, destruction, and change?<br /><br />Nicole Krauss has written a soaring, powerful novel about memory struggling to creat a meaningful permanence in the face of inevitable loss.<br /><br />(front flap)",3.47,5:2799|4:5417|3:5239|2:2066|1:658|total:16179,14503,2082,2010,W.

240,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,,Paperback,Doris Kearns Goodwin,916,"Acclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Abraham Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work, as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.<br /><br />On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.<br /><br />Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.<br /><br />It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.<br /><br />We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.<br /><br />This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.",4.28,5:71075|4:36255|3:13293|2:4066|1:4386|total:129075,122646,5836,2006,Simon  Schuster,eng,FALSE,743270754,743270754,869,870,2199,2199,2861004,40,743270754,9.78074E+12,"Doris Kearns Goodwin, Suzanne Toren",2005,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,eng,4.3,102923,107944,5875,3306,3095,11140,31184,59219,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347278868m/2199.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347278868s/2199.jpg,187,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,743270754,"['Abraham Lincoln', 'William H.

For celebrity medium Jaime Vegas, it is to be her swan song—one last publicity blast for a celebrity on the wrong side of forty. But unlike her colleagues, who are more show than substance, Jaime is the real thing. <br /><br />Reluctant to upstage her fellow spiritualists, Jaime tries to suppress her talents, as she has done her entire life. But there is something lurking in the maze of gardens behind the house: a spirit without a voice. And it won’t let go until somehow Jaime hears its terrible story. For the first time in her life, Jaime Vegas understands what humans mean when they say they are haunted. Distraught, Jaime looks to fellow supernatural Jeremy Danvers for help.<br /><br />As the touches and whispers from the garden grow more frantic, Jaime and Jeremy embark on an investigation into a Los Angeles underworld of black magic and ritual sacrifice.

Unseen and unsuspected, this realm of witches, ghosts, and werewolves is now threatened with exposure by a brutal series of bizarre murders that has left even the supernatural world baffled—and cold with terror....</i><br /><br />Being the world’s only female werewolf has its advantages, such as having her pick of the Otherworld’s most desirable males. And Elena Michaels couldn't have picked a more dangerously sexy and undyingly loyal mate than Clayton Danvers. Now their bond will be put to the ultimate test as they follow a bloody trail of gruesome slayings deep into Alaska’s frozen wilderness.<br /><br />There’s nothing the werewolf community dislikes more than calling attention to itself. So when a pair of rogue man-eaters begins hunting humans, it’s up to Elena and Clayton to track down the predators. But any illusions their task would be simple are quickly dispelled. For even in werewolf terms, there’s something very disturbing taking place in the dark Alaskan forests. A werewolf more wolf than human and more unnatural than supernatural is on the hunt—a creature whose origins seem to spring from ancient legends of the shape-shifting Wendigo.<br /><br />And if that wasn't bad enough, Clayton and Elena find themselves confronting painful ghosts from their pasts — and an issue neither of them is eager to discuss. For one of them has been chosen to become the new Pack leader, and as every wolf knows, there can be only one Alpha. They've always been equals in everything.

Joan Didion explores an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage–and a life, in good times and bad–that will speak to anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child.<br /><br />Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill with what seemed at first flu, then pneumonia, then complete septic shock. She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later–the night before New Year's Eve–the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John Gregory Dunne suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of forty years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LAX, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Center to relieve a massive hematoma.<br /><br />This powerful book is Didion's attempt to make sense of the ""weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness . . . about marriage and children and memory . . . about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.""",3.88,5:38079|4:42039|3:26143|2:8517|1:2975|total:117753,110526,8146,2007,Vintage,eng,FALSE,1400078431,1400078431,894,895,7815,7815,1659905,57,1400078431,9.7814E+12,Joan Didion,2005,The Year of Magical Thinking,The Year of Magical Thinking,eng,3.86,94590,99308,7729,2670,7410,22435,35538,31255,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327878638m/7815.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327878638s/7815.jpg,92,The Year of Magical Thinking,1400078431,,US$ 4.22,['United States of America'],"['National Book Award for Nonfiction (2005)', 'Puddly Award for Nonfiction (2006)']",Joan Didion,63,female,"Joan Didion was born in California and lives in New York City.

259,Bridge of Sighs,Bridge of Sighs,,Hardcover,Richard Russo,528,"Bridge of Sighs courses with small-town rhythms and the claims of family. Here is a town, as well as a world, defined by magnificent and nearly devastating contradictions.<br /><br />Louis Charles (“Lucy”) Lynch has spent all his sixty years in upstate Thomaston, New York, married to the same woman, Sarah, for forty of them, their son now a grown man. Like his late, beloved father, Lucy is an optimist, though he’s had plenty of reasons not to be—chief among them his mother, still indomitably alive. Yet it was her shrewdness, combined with that Lynch optimism, that had propelled them years ago to the right side of the tracks and created an “empire” of convenience stores about to be passed on to the next generation. <br /><br />Lucy and Sarah are also preparing for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Italy, where his oldest friend, a renowned painter, has exiled himself far from anything they’d known in childhood. In fact, the exact nature of their friendship is one of the many mysteries Lucy hopes to untangle in the “history” he’s writing of his hometown and family. And with his story interspersed with that of Noonan, the native son who’d fled so long ago, the destinies building up around both of them (and Sarah, too) are relentless, constantly surprising, and utterly revealing. <br /><br />Bridge of Sighs is classic Russo, coursing with small-town rhythms and the claims of family, yet it is brilliantly enlarged by an expatriate whose motivations and experiences—often contrary, sometimes not—prove every bit as mesmerizing as they resonate through these richly different lives.

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.<br /><br />Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.<br /><br />The final volume of the Wheel of Time, <i>A Memory of Light, </i> was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Mistborn books, and now Stormlight Archive, among others, was chosen by Jordan's editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final volume, later expanded to three books.<br /><br />In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.<br /><br />Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.<br /><br /><b>TV series update: </b>""Sony will produce along with Red Eagle Entertainment and Radar Pictures.

We were about to begin the adventure of realigning our lives with our food chain. <br /><br />""Naturally, our first stop was to buy junk food and fossil fuel..."" <br /><br />Hang on for the ride: With characteristic poetry and pluck, Barbara Kingsolver and her family sweep readers along on their journey away from the industrial-food pipeline to a rural life in which they vow to buy only food raised in their own neighborhood, grow it themselves, or learn to live without it. Their good-humored search yields surprising discoveries about turkey sex life and overly zealous zucchini plants, en route to a food culture that's better for the neighborhood and also better on the table. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, Animal, Vegetable, Miracle makes a passionate case for putting the kitchen back at the center of family life and diversified farms at the center of the American diet. <br /><br />""This is the story of a year in which we made every attempt to feed ourselves animals and vegetables whose provenance we really knew . . . and of how our family was changed by our first year of deliberately eating food produced from the same place where we worked, went to school, loved our neighbors, drank the water, and breathed the air.""",4.04,5:35650|4:33074|3:16778|2:4917|1:1774|total:92193,86083,9567,2007,HarperCollins Publishers,eng,FALSE,60852550,60852550,1020,1021,25460,25460,1582285,37,60852550,9.78006E+12,"Barbara Kingsolver, Steven L.

With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.<br /><br />Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction. <br /><br />Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed. <br /><br />Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change.

266,The Lacuna,The Lacuna,,Hardcover,Barbara Kingsolver,508,"In her most accomplished novel, Barbara Kingsolver takes us on an epic journey from the Mexico City of artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo to the America of Pearl Harbor, FDR, and J. Edgar Hoover. The Lacuna is a poignant story of a man pulled between two nations as they invent their modern identities. <br /><br />Born in the United States, reared in a series of provisional households in Mexico—from a coastal island jungle to 1930s Mexico City—Harrison Shepherd finds precarious shelter but no sense of home on his thrilling odyssey. Life is whatever he learns from housekeepers who put him to work in the kitchen, errands he runs in the streets, and one fateful day, by mixing plaster for famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. He discovers a passion for Aztec history and meets the exotic, imperious artist Frida Kahlo, who will become his lifelong friend. When he goes to work for Lev Trotsky, an exiled political leader fighting for his life, Shepherd inadvertently casts his lot with art and revolution, newspaper headlines and howling gossip, and a risk of terrible violence. <br /><br />Meanwhile, to the north, the United States will soon be caught up in the internationalist goodwill of World War II. There in the land of his birth, Shepherd believes he might remake himself in America's hopeful image and claim a voice of his own. He finds support from an unlikely kindred soul, his stenographer, Mrs. Brown, who will be far more valuable to her employer than he could ever know. Through darkening years, political winds continue to toss him between north and south in a plot that turns many times on the unspeakable breach—the lacuna—between truth and public presumption. <br /><br />With deeply compelling characters, a vivid sense of place, and a clear grasp of how history and public opinion can shape a life, Barbara Kingsolver has created an unforgettable portrait of the artist—and of art itself. The Lacuna is a rich and daring work of literature, establishing its author as one of the most provocative and important of her time.",3.78,5:15869|4:19509|3:11771|2:4587|1:2276|total:54012,48996,6824,2009,Harper,eng,FALSE,60852577,60852577,2084,2085,6433752,6433752,6812077,43,60852577,9.78006E+12,Barbara Kingsolver,2009,The Lacuna,The Lacuna,eng,3.76,45671,49846,7085,2202,4330,10958,17977,14379,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480104396m/6433752.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480104396s/6433752.jpg,206,The Lacuna,60852577,"['Leon Trotsky', 'Harrison William Shepherd', 'Frida Kahlo', 'Diego Rivera', 'Violet Brown']",US$ 3.70,"['Washington, D.C.', 'San Angel', 'Mexico City (México City)', 'Coyoacán', 'Asheville, North Carolina']","['Orange Prize for Fiction (2010)', 'PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction Nominee (2010)', 'International DUBLIN Literary Award Nominee (2011)']",Barbara Kingsolver,58,female,"Barbara Kingsolver is an American novelist, essayist, and poet.

270,Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,,Paperback,Michael   Lewis,317,"Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis's <i>Moneyball</i>, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans. <p> Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, <i>Moneyball</i> is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (<i>Liar's Poker</i>, <i>The New New Thing</i>), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes <i>Moneyball</i> an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. <i>--John Moe</i></p>",4.26,5:38323|4:31540|3:10290|2:1844|1:1011|total:83008,76525,3949,2004,W.

I was due on Valentine's Day but arrived a week early; my mother blamed this on a really exciting IU basketball game. My father was a psychologist at the University, but not that kind of psychologist. He studied animal behavior, and especially learning. He ran rats through mazes. My mother was a polio survivor, a schoolteacher, and a pioneer in the co-operative nursery school movement. Along with basketball, my family loved books. The day I got my first library card there was a special dinner to celebrate. And before I could read myself, I remember my father reading The Iliad to me, although really he was reading it to my older brother, I just got to be there. A shocking book! And I remember Mary Poppins and Winnie the Pooh in my father's voice and a bunch of other things that weren't movies yet. My parents strongly disapproved of the Disney version of things. Pooh believed in a spoonful of honey, but Mary Poppins did not.<br /><br />I have great memories of Bloomington. Our block was packed with kids and we played enormous games that covered whole blocks of territory, with ten kids to a side. One of my childhood friends was Theodore Deppe, who's now an outstanding poet. I planned to grow up to be a dog trainer myself.<br /><br />Both my parents were raised in southern California and so regarded our time in Indiana as an exile. When I was 11 years old my father was offered a job with Encyclopedia Britannica that necessitated our moving to Palo Alto, California. My parents were thrilled to be coming back. My older brother, for reasons that escape me, was equally pleased. I was devastated.<br /><br />Palo Alto was much more sophisticated than Bloomington. At recess in Bloomington we played baseball, skipped rope, played jacks or marbles depending on the season. In Palo Alto girls my age were already setting their hair, listening to the radio, talking about boys. I considered it a sad trade. The best thing about the sixth-grade was that my teacher, Miss Sarzin, read The Hobbit to us.<br /><br />After reading many more books, I graduated from Palo Alto High in 1968 and went to Berkeley. I was a political science major and an antiwar activist. I was in Berkeley during People's Park, when the city was occupied and there were tanks on the street corners, and I was there during the Jackson State/Kent State killings. I met my husband there. He'd been part of the free speech movement; that was my idea of glamor. We got married the year I graduated and we came to graduate school at UC Davis together.<br /><br />As an undergraduate I had a special interest in India and Gandhi, and a general interest in imperialism. I find the intersection of cultures fascinating, the misunderstandings that occur, the mistakes that are innocently made. I'm not so fascinated by the mistakes that aren't innocent, although there are a good many more of the latter kind. As a graduate student I focused on China and Japan. It's not clear to me what my career goals were — whatever, I had my first child during spring break of the last year of my masters. Six days less than two years later I had a second child. My husband and I still live in Davis, although the kids have left for college and beyond.<br /><br />I decided to try to be a writer on my 30th birthday.<br />All questions answered",2/7/1950,Alive,Unknown

</b><br /><br />BLOWN UP<br /><br />All New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has to do is bring in semi-retired bail jumper Eddie DeChooch. For an old man he's still got a knack for slipping out of sight--and raising hell. How else can Stephanie explain the bullet-riddled corpse in Eddie's garden? Who else would have a clue as to why two of Stephanie's friends suddenly vanished? For answers Stephanie has the devil to pay: her mentor, Ranger. The deal? He'll give Stephanie all the help she needs--if she gives him everything he wants...<br /><br />MESSED UP<br /><br />As if things weren't complicated enough, Stephanie's just discovered her Grandma Mazur's own unmentionable alliance with Eddie. Add a series of unnerving break-ins, not to mention the bombshell revelation leveled by Stephanie's estranged sister, and Stephanie's ready for some good news. Unfortunately, a marriage proposal from Joe Morelli, the love of her life, isn't quite cutting it. And now--murder, a randy paramour, a wily mobster, death threats, extortion, and a triple kidnapping aside--Stephanie's really got the urge to run for her life...<br /><br />~",4.16,5:41704|4:41029|3:20290|2:1939|1:277|total:105239,100254,1762,2002,St. Martin's Press,en-US,FALSE,312980140,312980140,1225,1226,6424,6424,3207062,70,312980140,9.78031E+12,Janet Evanovich,2001,Seven Up,"Seven Up (Stephanie Plum, #7)",en-US,4.15,94506,98706,1833,243,1819,19146,38698,38800,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1311720512m/6424.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1311720512s/6424.jpg,447,"Seven Up (Stephanie Plum, #7)",312980140,"['Joe Morelli', 'Ranger', 'Lula', 'Grandma Mazur', 'Walter ""Moonman"" Dunphy', '...more', 'Eddie DeCooch', 'Dougie ""The Dealer"" Kruper', 'Loretta Ricci', 'Stephanie Plum', '...less']",US$ 3.54,"['Trenton, New Jersey']",,Janet Evanovich,113,female,"Janet Evanovich is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum series, the Lizzy and Diesel series, twelve romance novels, the Alexandra Barnaby novels and Trouble Maker graphic novel, and How I Write: Secrets of a Bestselling Author, as well as the Fox and O'Hare series with co-author Lee Goldberg.",Unknown,Alive,Unknown

During the divorce proceedings, he and Evelyn signed a child custody bond, and Steven is demanding the money guaranteed by the bond to find Annie. The money was secured by a mortgage on Evelyn's grandmother's house, and the True Blue Bonds Bail Agency wants to take possession of the house.<br /><br />Finding a kidnapped child is not an assignment for a bounty hunter. But Evelyn's grandmother lives next door to Stephanie's parents, and Stephanie's mother and grandmother are not about to see their neighbor lose her house because of abduction.<br /><br />Even though Stephanie's plate is full with miscreants who missed their court dates, including old nemesis and violent drunk Andy Bender and an elusive little old lady accused of grand theft auto, she can't disappoint Grandma Mazur! So she follows the trail left by Annie and Evelyn-- and finds a lot more than she bargained for. Steven is somehow linked with a very scary Eddie Abruzzi. Trenton cop and on-again, off-again fiance Joe Morelli and Stephanie's mentor and tormentor, Ranger, warn Stephanie about Abruzzi, but it's Abruzzi's eyes and mannerisms that frighten Stephanie the most. Stephanie needs Ranger's savvy and expertise, and she's willing to accept his help to find Annie even though it might mean becoming too involved with Ranger.<br /><br />Stephanie, Ranger, Lula (who's not going to miss riding with Ranger), and Evelyn's lawyer/laundromat manager set out to find Annie.

My older sister, Helen, was very much like our mother: gentle, family-oriented, eager to please. Little brother Jon was the only boy and had interests that he shared with Dad; together they were always working on electric trains and erector sets; and later, when Jon was older, they always seemed to have their heads under the raised hood of a car. That left me in-between, and exactly where I wanted most to be: on my own. I was a solitary child who lived in the world of books and my own vivid imagination.<br /><br />Because my father was a career military officer - an Army dentist - I lived all over the world. I was born in Hawaii, moved from there to New York, spent the years of World War II in my mother’s hometown: Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and from there went to Tokyo when I was eleven. High school was back in New York City, but by the time I went to college (Brown University in Rhode Island), my family was living in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />I married young. I had just turned nineteen - just finished my sophomore year in college - when I married a Naval officer and continued the odyssey that military life requires. California. Connecticut (a daughter born there). Florida (a son). South Carolina. Finally Cambridge, Massachusetts, when my husband left the service and entered Harvard Law School (another daughter; another son) and then to Maine - by now with four children under the age of five in tow. My children grew up in Maine. So did I. I returned to college at the University of Southern Maine, got my degree, went to graduate school, and finally began to write professionally, the thing I had dreamed of doing since those childhood years when I had endlessly scribbled stories and poems in notebooks.<br /><br />After my marriage ended in 1977, when I was forty, I settled into the life I have lived ever since. Today I am back in Cambridge, Massachusetts, living and writing in a house dominated by a very shaggy Tibetan Terrier named Bandit. For a change of scenery Martin and I spend time in Maine, where we have an old (it was built in 1768!) farmhouse on top of a hill. In Maine I garden, feed birds, entertain friends, and read...<br /><br />My books have varied in content and style. Yet it seems that all of them deal, essentially, with the same general theme: the importance of human connections. A Summer to Die, my first book, was a highly fictionalized retelling of the early death of my sister, and of the effect of such a loss on a family. Number the Stars, set in a different culture and era, tells the same story: that of the role that we humans play in the lives of our fellow beings.<br /><br />The Giver - and Gathering Blue, and the newest in the trilogy: Messenger - take place against the background of very different cultures and times. Though all three are broader in scope than my earlier books, they nonetheless speak to the same concern: the vital need of people to be aware of their interdependence, not only with each other, but with the world and its environment.<br /><br />My older son was a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force. His death in the cockpit of a warplane tore away a piece of my world. But it left me, too, with a wish to honor him by joining the many others trying to find a way to end conflict on this very fragile earth.<br />I am a grandmother now.

What no one knows is that the President issues the pardon only after receiving enormous pressure from the CIA. It seems Backman, in his power broker heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the world's most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.<br /><br />Backman is quietly smuggled out of the country in a military cargo plane, given a new name, a new identity, and a new home in Italy. Eventually, after he has settled into his new life, the CIA will leak his whereabouts to the Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Saudis. Then the CIA will do what it does best: sit back and watch. The question is not whether Backman will survive, there is no chance of that.

308,Playing for Pizza,Playing for Pizza,,Hardcover,John Grisham,262,"Rick Dockery was the third-string quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. In the AFC Championship game against Denver, to the surprise and dismay of virtually everyone, Rick actually got into the game. With a 17-point lead and just minutes to go, Rick provided what was arguably the worst single performance in the history of the NFL. Overnight, he became a national laughingstock and, of course, was immediately cut by the Browns and shunned by all other teams.<br /><br />But all Rick knows is football, and he insists that his agent, Arnie, find a team that needs him. Against enormous odds Arnie finally locates just such a team and informs Rick that, miraculously, he can in fact now be a starting quarterback–for the mighty Panthers of Parma, Italy.<br /><br />Yes, Italians do play American football, to one degree or another, and the Parma Panthers desperately want a former NFL player–any former NFL player–at their helm. So Rick reluctantly agrees to play for the Panthers–at least until a better offer comes along–and heads off to Italy. He knows nothing about Parma, has never been to Europe, and doesn’t speak or understand a word of Italian. To say that Italy holds a few surprises for Rick Dockery would be something of an understatement.",3.43,5:6935|4:12061|3:14419|2:5408|1:1523|total:40346,37393,3538,2007,Doubleday Books,eng,FALSE,385525001,385525001,2814,2815,1205297,1205297,3090264,66,385525001,9.78039E+12,John Grisham,2007,Playing For Pizza,Playing for Pizza,en-US,3.41,34577,36850,3642,1436,5072,13273,10948,6121,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,2356,Playing for Pizza,385525001,['Rick Dockery'],US$ 3.51,"['Parma', '\n']",,John Grisham,267,male,"""Long before his name became synonymous with the modern legal thriller, he was working 60-70 hours a week at a small Southaven, Mississippi law practice, squeezing in time before going to the office and during courtroom recesses to work on his hobby—writing his first novel.<br /><br />Born on February 8, 1955 in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to a construction worker and a homemaker, John Grisham as a child dreamed of being a professional baseball player.

319,The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents ,"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents (Discworld, #28)","Discworld, #28",Hardcover,Terry Pratchett,256,"<b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b><br />With the debut of his first young-adult novel, science fiction writer Terry Pratchett invites readers ages 12 and up to visit Discworld -- an imaginary land well known to Pratchett's adult following. At the heart of this tale is a slightly twisted take on the old Pied Piper theme, a talking, thinking cat named Maurice, and a supporting cast of equally talented rats who bear such comical names as Big Savings, Nourishing, and Dangerous Beans. <br /><p><br />Maurice and the rats have teamed up with a young lad named Keith to implement a clever moneymaking scheme. Upon entering a town, the rats make a general nuisance of themselves -- stealing food and widdling on things -- until the townsfolk become desperate to get rid of them. Then Maurice and Keith appear on the scene and offer to save the day by ridding the town of its infestation for a small fee. It seems like a surefire plan until the group arrives in the town of Bad Blintz and gets hooked up with Malicia, a young girl with a vivid imagination and a knack for finding trouble. When it's discovered that Bad Blintz already has a rat problem -- one that a couple of shifty-eyed rat catchers claim to have under control -- things turn deadly. For lurking beneath the town's streets is an obstacle course of mangling rattraps and noxious poisons. And beyond that is a monster so powerful and ugly, even Malicia couldn't imagine it. <br /></p><p><br />As Maurice and the rats battle for their very survival, a number of provocative themes surface: life after death, good versus evil, and the sacrifice of the few for the many. But be forewarned -- those in search of lighter fare in these troubled times may not find what they are looking for in Pratchett's vision Despite plenty of razor-sharp wit and lighthearted moments, this tale has an underbelly as dark as the tunnels beneath Bad Blintz. Though <i>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</i> is deeply witty and engaging, some readers may find parts of the story -- descriptions of how some of the rats die and how others eat their dead -- rather intense. <i>(Beth Amos)</i></p>",4.05,5:11762|4:12936|3:7140|2:1155|1:193|total:33186,26982,872,2001,HarperCollins,eng,FALSE,006001234X,006001234X,4564,4565,34534,34534,1179689,75,006001234X,9.78006E+12,Terry Pratchett,2001,The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents ,"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents (Discworld, #28)",eng,4.04,24279,29463,1145,182,1080,6461,11448,10292,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,4956,"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents (Discworld, #28)",006001234X,,US$ 5.65,,"['Geffen Award for Best Translated YA Book (2014)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2007)', 'Carnegie Medal (2001)']",Terry Pratchett,401,male,"Born Terence David John Pratchett, Sir Terry Pratchett sold his first story when he was thirteen, which earned him enough money to buy a second-hand typewriter.

She has no toes, wears strange lacy trousers like the grandfather bird, and gives him a stick that can make fire.<br />Daphne, sole survivor of the wreck of the Sweet Judy, almost immediately regrets trying to shoot the native boy. Thank goodness the powder was wet and the gun only produced a spark. She’s certain her father, distant cousin of the Royal family, will come and rescue her but it seems, for now, that all she has for company is the boy and the foul-mouthed ship’s parrot, until other survivors arrive to take refuge on the island. Together, Mau and Daphne discover some remarkable things (including how to milk a pig, and why spitting in beer is a good thing), and start to forge a new nation.<br /><br />Encompassing themes of death and nationhood, Terry Pratchett’s new novel is, as can be expected, extremely funny, witty and wise.

But within hours the cops have it solved: a slam-dunk case. Except for one thing. The accused man says: You got the wrong guy. Then he says: Get Reacher for me. And sure enough, from the world he lives in—no phone, no address, no commitments–ex–military investigator Jack Reacher is coming. In Lee Child’s astonishing new thriller, Reacher’s arrival will change everything—about a case that isn’t what it seems, about lives tangled in baffling ways, about a killer who missed one shot–and by doing so give Jack Reacher one shot at the truth.…<br /><br />The gunman worked from a parking structure just thirty yards away–point-blank range for a trained military sniper like James Barr. His victims were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But why does Barr want Reacher at his side? There are good reasons why Reacher is the last person Barr would want to see. But when Reacher hears Barr’s own words, he understands. And a slam-dunk case explodes. Soon Reacher is teamed with a young defense lawyer who is working against her D.A. father and dueling with a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. Like most things Reacher has known in life, this case is a complex battlefield. But, as always, in battle, Reacher is at his best.<br /><br />Moving in the shadows, picking his spots, Reacher gets closer and closer to the unseen enemy who is pulling the strings.

In Chicago, a woman learns that an elite team of ex–army investigators is being hunted down one by one.... And on the streets of Portland, Jack Reacher—soldier, cop, hero—is pulled out of his wandering life by a code that few other people could understand. From the first shocking scenes in Lee Child’s explosive new novel, Jack Reacher is plunged like a knife into the heart of a conspiracy that is killing old friends…and is on its way to something even worse.<br /><br />A decade postmilitary, Reacher has an ATM card and the clothes on his back—no phone, no ties, and no address. But now a woman from his old unit has done the impossible. From Chicago, Frances Neagley finds Reacher, using a signal only the eight members of their elite team of army investigators would know. She tells him a terrifying story—about the brutal death of a man they both served with. Soon Reacher is reuniting with the survivors of his old team, scrambling to raise the living, bury the dead, and connect the dots in a mystery that is growing darker by the day.

Set in 1985 in a world that is similar to our own, but with a few crucial - and bizarre - differences (Wales is a socialist republic, the Crimean War is still ongoing and the most popular pets are home-cloned dodos), The Eyre Affair introduces literary detective named 'Thursday Next'. Thursday's job includes spotting forgeries of Shakespeare's lost plays, mending holes in narrative plot lines, and rescuing characters who have been kidnapped from literary masterpieces.<br /><br />Luckily for Jasper, the novel garnered dozens of effusive reviews, and received high praise from the press, from booksellers and readers throughout the UK. In the US The Eyre Affair was also an instant hit, entering the New York Times Bestseller List in its first week of publication. <br /><br />Since then, Jasper has added another six to the Thursday Next series and has also begun a second series that he calls 'Nursery Crime', featuring Jack Spratt of The Nursery Crime Division. In the first book, 'The Big Over Easy', Humpty Dumpty is the victim in a whodunnit, and in the second, 'The Fourth Bear', the Three Bear's connection to Goldilocks disappearance can finally be revealed. <br /><br />In January 2010 Fforde published 'Shades of Grey', in which a fragmented society struggle to survive in a colour-obsessed post-apocalyptic landscape. <br /><br />His latest series is for Young Adults and include 'The Last Dragonslayer' (2010), 'Song of the Quarkbeast' (2011) and 'The Eye of Zoltar' (2013). All the books centre around Jennifer Strange, who manages a company of magicians named 'Kazam', and her attempts to keep the noble arts from the clutches of big business and property tycoons.<br /><br />Jasper's 14th Book, 'Early Riser', a thriller set in a world in which humans have always hibernated, is due out in the UK in August 2018, and in the US in 2019.<br /><br />Fforde failed his Welsh Nationality Test by erroneously identifying Gavin Henson as a TV chef, but continues to live and work in his adopted nation despite this setback.

After two rollicking New York Times bestselling adventures through the Western literary canon, Britain's Prose-Op is literally and literaturally at her wits' end—not to mention pregnant. Her job as Miss Havisham's apprentice at Jurisfiction is as hectic as ever—and not just because she has to moderate rage counseling sessions in Wuthering Heights. So what could be more welcome than a restful stint in the Character Exchange Program down in the hidden depths of the Well of Lost Plots? <br /><br />She's supposed to relax while filling in for a sidekick in an unpublished (and unpublishable) detective procedural socked away below the Great Library in the Well of Lost Plots. But a vacation remains elusive.

331,Shades of Grey ,"Shades of Grey (Shades of Grey, #1)","Shades of Grey, #1",,Jasper Fforde,400,"<b>From the bestselling author of <i>Thursday Next</i> — a brilliant new novel about a world where social order and destiny are dictated by the colors you can see </b><br /><br /> Part social satire, part romance, part revolutionary thriller, <i>Shades of Grey</i> tells of a battle against overwhelming odds. In a society where the ability to see the higher end of the color spectrum denotes a better social standing, Eddie Russet belongs to the low-level House of Red and can see his own color—but no other. The sky, the grass, and everything in between are all just shades of grey, and must be colorized by artificial means.<br /><br /> Eddie's world wasn't always like this. There's evidence of a never-discussed disaster and now, many years later, technology is poor, news sporadic, the notion of change abhorrent, and nighttime is terrifying: no one can see in the dark. Everyone abides by a bizarre regime of rules and regulations, a system of merits and demerits, where punishment can result in permanent expulsion.<br /><br /> Eddie, who works for the Color Control Agency, might well have lived out his rose-tinted life without a hitch. But that changes when he becomes smitten with Jane, a Grey, which is low-caste in this color-centric world. She shows Eddie that all is not well with the world he thinks is just and good. Together, they engage in dangerous revolutionary talk.<br /><br /> Stunningly imaginative, very funny, tightly plotted, and with sly satirical digs at our own society, this novel is for those who loved <i>Thursday Next</i> but want to be transported somewhere equally wild, only darker; a world where the black and white of moral standpoints have been reduced to shades of grey.",4.14,5:12581|4:10890|3:4507|2:1224|1:456|total:29658,24827,3166,,Penguin Group Viking Adult,eng,FALSE,670019631,670019631,4963,4964,2113260,2113260,2118671,35,670019631,9.78067E+12,Jasper Fforde,2009,Shades of Grey,Shades of Grey,eng,4.14,22788,26840,3612,425,1098,4097,9941,11279,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327563734m/2113260.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327563734s/2113260.jpg,1015,"Shades of Grey (Shades of Grey, #1)",670019631,,US$ 4.04,,"['Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'Warwick Prize for Writing Nominee for Longlist (2011)', 'Prix Julia Verlanger (2012)']",Jasper Fforde,37,male,"Fforde began his career in the film industry, and for nineteen years held a variety of posts on such movies as Goldeneye, The Mask of Zorro and Entrapment.

Can Swindon win the world croquet championship and thus prevent the end of the world? All this and more is revealed in this, the 4th volume in the Thursday Next series.<br /><br />Detective Thursday Next has had her fill of her responsibilities as the Bellmanin Jurisfiction, enough with Emperor Zhark's pointlessly dramatic entrances, outbreaks of slapstick raging across pulp genres, and hacking her hair off to fill in for Joan of Arc. Packing up her son, Friday, Thursday returns to Swindon accompanied by none other than the dithering Danish prince Hamlet. Caring for both is more than a full- time job and Thursday decides it is definitely time to get her husband Landen back, if only to babysit. Luckily, those responsible for Landen's eradication, The Goliath Corporation— formerly an oppressive multinational conglomerate, now an oppressive multinational religion— have pledged to right the wrong. <br /><br />But returning to SpecOps isn't a snap. When outlaw fictioneer Yorrick Kaine seeks to get himself elected dictator, he whips up a frenzy of anti-Danish sentiment and demands mass book burnings. The return of Swindon's patron saint bearing divine prophecies could spell the end of the world within five years, possibly faster if the laughably terrible Swindon Mallets don't win the Superhoop, the most important croquet tournament in the land. And if that's not bad enough, The Merry Wives of Windsor is becoming entangled with Hamlet. Can Thursday find a Shakespeare clone to stop this hostile takeover? Can she prevent the world from plunging into war? Can she vanquish Kaine before he realizes his dream of absolute power? And, most important, will she ever find reliable child care?

Since the no-nonsense literary detective from Swindon made her debut, literature has never been quite the same. Neither have nursery rhymes, for that matter. With two successful books of the Nursery Crime series under his belt, Fforde takes up once again the brilliant adventures of his signature creation in the highly anticipated fifth installment of the Thursday Next series. And it's better than ever. <br /><br /> It's been fourteen years since Thursday pegged out at the 1988 SuperHoop, and Friday is now a difficult sixteen year old. However, Thursday's got bigger problems. Sherlock Holmes is killed at the Reichenbach Falls and his series is stopped in its tracks. And before this can be corrected, Miss Marple dies suddenly in a car accident, bringing her series to a close as well. When Thursday receives a death threat clearly intended for her written self, she realizes what's going on: there is a serial killer on the loose in the Bookworld. And that's not all--The Goliath Corporation is trying to deregulate book travel. Naturally, Thursday must travel to the outer limits of acceptable narrative possibilities to triumph against increasing odds. <br /><br /> Packed with word play, bizarre and entertaining subplots, and old-fashioned suspense, Thursday's return is sure to be celebrated by Jasper's fanatical fans and the critics who have loved him since the beginning.",4.01,5:7055|4:9673|3:5023|2:729|1:94|total:22574,19915,1271,2007,Viking Adult,eng,FALSE,670038717,670038717,6827,6828,27002,27002,948585,39,670038717,9.78067E+12,Jasper Fforde,2007,First Among Sequels ,"First Among Sequels (Thursday Next, #5)",eng,4,18722,20982,1447,91,703,4725,8973,6490,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1338467549m/27002.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1338467549s/27002.jpg,2470,"First Among Sequels (Thursday Next, #5)",670038717,['Thursday Next'],US$ 4.04,"['United Kingdom', 'BookWorld']",,Jasper Fforde,37,male,"Fforde began his career in the film industry, and for nineteen years held a variety of posts on such movies as Goldeneye, The Mask of Zorro and Entrapment.

And don't even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation. <br /><br />Whether deconstructing <i>Saved by the Bell</i> episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he'll make you laugh, and he'll drive you insane -- usually all at once. <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</i> is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, but -- really -- it's about us.

Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me, I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong. <br /><br />Martin<br />I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed."" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right. <br /><br />Jess<br />I was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously. <br /><br />JJ<br />New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake). If anybody had been on the roof on either of those nights, the chances are they would have been like-minded souls, rather than hopeless f*ck-ups who had somehow persuaded themselves that the end of a calendar year is in any way significant.</i>",3.42,5:9896|4:23969|3:27149|2:9060|1:2276|total:72350,63293,3867,2006,Riverhead Books,eng,FALSE,1594481938,1594481938,1420,1421,10073,10073,2961964,89,1594481938,9.78159E+12,Nick Hornby,2005,A Long Way Down,A Long Way Down,eng,3.41,59843,67676,4553,2135,8570,25521,22277,9173,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1467861525m/10073.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1467861525s/10073.jpg,709,A Long Way Down,1594481938,"['Maureen', 'JJ', 'Martin Sharp', 'Jess Crichton']",US$ 3.96,,,Nick Hornby,73,male,"Nick Hornby is the author of the novels <i>A Long Way Down, Slam, <i>How to Be Good</i>, High Fidelity</i>, and <i>About a Boy</i>, and the memoir <i>Fever Pitch</i>.

With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..."" <br /><br /><i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.<br /><br />In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.<br /><br /><i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> tells perhaps the greatest sea story ever. Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.<br /><br />At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville, <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> will endure as a vital work of American history.",4.16,5:29054|4:28686|3:10921|2:2006|1:999|total:71666,66577,4651,2001,Penguin Books,eng,FALSE,141001828,141001828,1513,1514,17780,17780,1640941,86,141001828,9.78014E+12,Nathaniel Philbrick,1999,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,en-US,4.16,57259,61145,4593,743,1672,9369,24755,24606,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335902168m/17780.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335902168s/17780.jpg,266,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,141001828,"['George Pollard', 'Thomas Nickerson', 'Owen Chase', 'Benjamin Lawrence', 'Matthew Joy', '...more', 'Thomas Chappel', 'Owen Coffin', 'Barzillai Ray', '...less']",US$ 3.58,"['Nantucket, Massachusetts', 'South Pacific']","['National Book Award for Nonfiction (2000)', 'Ambassador Book Award for American Studies (2001)', 'Massachusetts Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2001)', 'ALA Alex Award (2001)']",Nathaniel Philbrick,32,Unknown,"Philbrick was Brown’s first Intercollegiate All-American sailor in 1978; that year he won the Sunfish North Americans in Barrington, RI; today he and his wife Melissa sail their Beetle Cat Clio and their Tiffany Jane 34 Marie-J in the waters surrounding Nantucket Island.<br /><br />After grad school, Philbrick worked for four years at Sailing World magazine; was a freelancer for a number of years, during which time he wrote/edited several sailing books, including Yaahting: A Parody (1984), for which he was the editor-in-chief; during this time he was also the primary caregiver for his two children.

But in the inevitable condition of aging and death, the goals of medicine seem too frequently to run counter to the interest of the human spirit. Nursing homes, preoccupied with safety, pin patients into railed beds and wheelchairs. Hospitals isolate the dying, checking for vital signs long after the goals of cure have become moot. Doctors, committed to extending life, continue to carry out devastating procedures that in the end extends suffering.<br /><br />Gawande, a practicing surgeon, addresses his profession's ultimate limitation, arguing that quality of life is the desired goal for patients and families. Gawande offers examples of freer, more socially fulfilling models for assisting the infirm and dependent elderly, and he explores the varieties of hospice care to demonstrate that a person's last weeks or months may be rich and dignified.<br /><br />Full of eye-opening research and riveting storytelling, Being Mortal asserts that medicine can comfort and enhance our experience even to the end, providing not only a good life but also a good end.",4.44,5:56862|4:28185|3:7532|2:1849|1:1160|total:95588,81036,10593,2014,Metropolitan Books,eng,FALSE,805095152,805095152,1576,1577,20696006,20696006,40015533,62,805095152,9.78081E+12,Atul Gawande,2014,Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,eng,4.4,56510,65567,8698,982,1507,5579,19732,37767,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408324949m/20696006.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408324949s/20696006.jpg,2029,Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,805095152,,US$ 7.09,,"['Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee for Longlist (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2014)', 'Royal Society of Biology General Book Prize (2015)']",Atul Gawande,20,male,"Atul Gawande is author of three bestselling books: <i>Complications</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award; <i>Better</i>, selected by Amazon.com as one of the ten best books of 2007; and <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i>.

Longer training, ever more advanced technologies‚neither seems to prevent grievous errors. But in a hopeful turn, acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist.<br /><br />First introduced decades ago by the U.S. Air Force, checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world, helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches. Even in the immensely complex world of surgery, a simple ninety-second variant has cut the rate of fatalities by more than a third.<br /><br />In riveting stories, Gawande takes us from Austria, where an emergency checklist saved a drowning victim who had spent half an hour underwater, to Michigan, where a cleanliness checklist in intensive care units virtually eliminated a type of deadly hospital infection. He explains how checklists actually work to prompt striking and immediate improvements. And he follows the checklist revolution into fields well beyond medicine, from homeland security to investment banking, skyscraper construction, and businesses of all kinds.<br /><br />An intellectual adventure in which lives are lost and saved and one simple idea makes a tremendous difference, <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i> is essential reading for anyone working to get things right. </p>",4.04,5:12841|4:14866|3:7285|2:1461|1:360|total:36813,30137,2933,2009,Metropolitan Books,,FALSE,805091742,805091742,3602,3603,6667514,6667514,6862414,30,805091742,9.78081E+12,Atul Gawande,2009,The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right,The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right,,4.02,23778,28234,2701,282,1164,5714,11489,9585,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312061594m/6667514.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312061594s/6667514.jpg,1959,The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right,805091742,,US$ 2.54,,,Atul Gawande,20,male,"Atul Gawande is author of three bestselling books: <i>Complications</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award; <i>Better</i>, selected by Amazon.com as one of the ten best books of 2007; and <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i>.

He has been described by the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> as the ""master of the non-fiction narrative."" This powerful and inspiring new book shows how one person can make a difference, as Kidder tells the true story of a gifted man who is in love with the world and has set out to do all he can to cure it.<br /><br />At the center of <i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> stands Paul Farmer. Doctor, Harvard professor, renowned infectious-disease specialist, anthropologist, the recipient of a MacArthur ""genius"" grant, world-class Robin Hood, Farmer was brought up in a bus and on a boat, and in medical school found his life’s calling: to diagnose and cure infectious diseases and to bring the lifesaving tools of modern medicine to those who need them most. This magnificent book shows how radical change can be fostered in situations that seem insurmountable, and it also shows how a meaningful life can be created, as Farmer—brilliant, charismatic, charming, both a leader in international health and a doctor who finds time to make house calls in Boston and the mountains of Haiti—blasts through convention to get results.<br /><br /><i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> takes us from Harvard to Haiti, Peru, Cuba, and Russia as Farmer changes minds and practices through his dedication to the philosophy that ""the only real nation is humanity""—a philosophy that is embodied in the small public charity he founded, Partners in Health. He enlists the help of the Gates Foundation, George Soros, the U.N.’s World Health Organization, and others in his quest to cure the world. At the heart of this book is the example of a life based on hope, and on an understanding of the truth of the Haitian proverb ""Beyond mountains there are mountains"": as you solve one problem, another problem presents itself, and so you go on and try to solve that one too.<br /><br />""<i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> unfolds with the force of a gathering revelation,"" says Annie Dillard, and Jonathan Harr says, ""[Farmer] wants to change the world.

Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of–and, ultimately, a participant in–their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she’s a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault.

354,American Wife,American Wife,,Hardcover,Curtis Sittenfeld,555,"On what might become one of the most significant days in her husband’s presidency, Alice Blackwell considers the strange and unlikely path that has led her to the White House–and the repercussions of a life lived, as she puts it, <i>“almost in opposition to itself.”</i><br /><br />A kind, bookish only child born in the 1940s, Alice learned the virtues of politeness early on from her stolid parents and small Wisconsin hometown. But a tragic accident when she was seventeen shattered her identity and made her understand the fragility of life and the tenuousness of luck. So more than a decade later, when she met boisterous, charismatic Charlie Blackwell, she hardly gave him a second look: She was serious and thoughtful, and he would rather crack a joke than offer a real insight; he was the wealthy son of a bastion family of the Republican party, and she was a school librarian and registered Democrat. Comfortable in her quiet and unassuming life, she felt inured to his charms. And then, much to her surprise, Alice fell for Charlie.<br /><br />As Alice learns to make her way amid the clannish energy and smug confidence of the Blackwell family, navigating the strange rituals of their country club and summer estate, she remains uneasy with her newfound good fortune. And when Charlie eventually becomes President, Alice is thrust into a position she did not seek–one of power and influence, privilege and responsibility. As Charlie’s tumultuous and controversial second term in the White House wears on, Alice must face contradictions years in the making: How can she both love and fundamentally disagree with her husband? How complicit has she been in the trajectory of her own life? What should she do when her private beliefs run against her public persona?<br /><br />In Alice Blackwell, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Curtis Sittenfeld has created her most dynamic and complex heroine yet. <i>American Wife</i> is a gorgeously written novel that weaves class, wealth, race, and the exigencies of fate into a brilliant tapestry–a novel in which the unexpected becomes inevitable, and the pleasures and pain of intimacy and love are laid bare.<br /><br /><br />Audiobook download time: 23:24:00",3.73,5:9682|4:19578|3:12911|2:3322|1:904|total:46397,42056,5423,,,eng,FALSE,1400064759,1400064759,2629,2630,2807199,2807199,2833088,37,1400064759,9.7814E+12,Curtis Sittenfeld,2008,American Wife,American Wife,eng,3.72,38537,41909,5568,822,3047,11813,17742,8485,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1443,American Wife,1400064759,['Alice Lindgren'],US$ 3.94,,['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2009)'],Curtis Sittenfeld,19,male,"Curtis Sittenfeld is the author of the new novel <i>Eligible</i>, a modern retelling of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (due out April 2016) as well as the bestselling novels <i>Sisterland</i>, <i>American Wife</i>, <i>Prep</i>, and <i>The Man of My Dreams</i>, which have been translated into twenty-five languages.

</b><br /><br />Bestselling author Jeffrey Archer returns with a powerful tale of twins separated by fate and reunited by destiny.<br /><br />In the late 1940's in Hartford, Connecticut a set of twins is parted at birth. Nat Cartwright goes home with his parents, a schoolteacher and an insurance salesman. But his twin brother is to begin his days as Fletcher Andrew Davenport, the only son of a multi-millionaire and his society wife. <br /><br />During the years that follow, the two brothers grow up unaware of each other's existence. Nat leaves college at the University of Connecticut to serve in Vietnam. He returns a war hero, finishes school and becomes a successful banker. Fletcher, meanwhile, has graduated from Yale University and distinguishes himself as a criminal defense lawyer before he is elected to the Senate. <br /><br />Even when Nat and Fletcher fall in love with the same girl they still don't meet. They continue on their separate paths until one has to defend the other for a murder he did not commit. But the final confrontation comes when Nat and Fletcher are selected to stand against each other for governor of the state.<br /><br />In the tradition of Jeffrey Archer's most popular books, <i>Sons of Fortune</i> is as much a chronicle of a nation in transition as it is the story of two remarkable men and how, eventually, they come to discover the truth - and its extraordinary consequences...",3.85,5:4147|4:6562|3:4387|2:826|1:194|total:16116,14685,453,2003,Pan,eng,FALSE,033041335X,033041335X,6068,6069,78985,78985,1758882,46,033041335X,9.78033E+12,Jeffrey Archer,2002,Sons of Fortune,Sons of Fortune,eng,3.83,13731,14757,481,183,770,4118,6012,3674,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1787,Sons of Fortune,033041335X,"['Nat Cartwright', 'Fletcher Davenport']",US$ 4.84,"['United States of America', 'Hartford, Connecticut']",,Jeffrey Archer,240,male,"Jeffrey Howard Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare (born 15 April 1940) is an English author and former politician.<br /><br />He was a Member of Parliament and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, and became a life peer in 1992.

Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown.<br /><br />For sixty years, Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a ""temporary"" safe haven created in the wake of revelations of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. <br /><br />But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can't catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman's new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman's nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. <br /><br />At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.<br />(front flap)",3.7,5:12608|4:22831|3:15131|2:4574|1:1747|total:56891,50557,5499,2007,HarperCollins,eng,FALSE,7149824,7149824,1872,1873,16703,16703,95855,58,7149824,9.78001E+12,Michael Chabon,2007,The Yiddish Policemen's Union,The Yiddish Policemen's Union,eng,3.69,46854,52340,6024,1649,4243,14023,21009,11416,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,154,The Yiddish Policemen's Union,7149824,"['Meyer Landsman', 'Berko Shemets', 'Bina Gelbfish', 'Ester-Malke Shemets', 'Hertz Shemets', '...more', 'Alter Litvak', 'Mendel Shpilman', 'Itzik Zimbalist', 'Naomi Landsman', '...less']",US$ 3.94,"['Sitka, Alaska']","['Hugo Award for Best Novel (2008)', 'Nebula Award for Best Novel (2007)', 'Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel (2008)', 'Hammett Prize Nominee (2007)', 'California Book Award for Fiction (Gold) (2007)', 'John W.

He has been married for thirty years to Kiki, an American woman who no longer resembles the sexy activist she once was. Their three children passionately pursue their own paths: Levi quests after authentic blackness, Zora believes that intellectuals can redeem everybody, and Jerome struggles to be a believer in a family of strict atheists. Faced with the oppressive enthusiasms of his children, Howard feels that the first two acts of his life are over and he has no clear plans for the finale.

366,The Grand Design,The Grand Design,,Hardcover,Stephen Hawking,199,"THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT THINKERS—A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFE<br /> <br />When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? <br /><br />The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. <br /><br />In <i>The Grand Design</i> they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and <br /><br />Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.<br /><br />Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.<br /><br />A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, <i>The Grand Design</i> is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.",4.03,5:20696|4:20203|3:10237|2:2372|1:1300|total:54808,49909,1893,2010,Bantam,eng,FALSE,553805371,553805371,1984,1985,8520362,8520362,13383926,80,553805371,9.78055E+12,"Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow",2010,The Grand Design,The Grand Design,eng,4,42687,46147,1962,1107,2090,9079,17175,16696,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320558363m/8520362.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320558363s/8520362.jpg,1324,The Grand Design,553805371,,US$ 5.16,,,Stephen Hawking,142,male,"Stephen William Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England. His parents' house was in north London, but during the second world war Oxford was considered a safer place to have babies. When he was eight, his family moved to St Albans, a town about 20 miles north of London. At eleven Stephen went to St Albans School, and then on to University College, Oxford, his father's old college. Stephen wanted to do Mathematics, although his father would have preferred medicine. Mathematics was not available at University College, so he did Physics instead. After three years and not very much work he was awarded a first class honours degree in Natural Science.<br /><br />Stephen then went on to Cambridge to do research in Cosmology, there being no-one working in that area in Oxford at the time. His supervisor was Denis Sciama, although he had hoped to get Fred Hoyle who was working in Cambridge. After gaining his Ph.D. he became first a Research Fellow, and later on a Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. After leaving the Institute of Astronomy in 1973 Stephen came to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, and since 1979 has held the post of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. The chair was founded in 1663 with money left in the will of the Reverend Henry Lucas, who had been the Member of Parliament for the University. It was first held by Isaac Barrow, and then in 1669 by Isaac Newton.<br /><br />Stephen Hawking worked on the basic laws which govern the universe. With Roger Penrose he showed that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity implied space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. These results indicated it was necessary to unify General Relativity with Quantum Theory, the other great Scientific development of the first half of the 20th Century. One consequence of such a unification that he discovered was that black holes should not be completely black, but should emit radiation and eventually evaporate and disappear. Another conjecture is that the universe has no edge or boundary in imaginary time. This would imply that the way the universe began was completely determined by the laws of science.<br /><br />His many publications include The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime with G.F.R. Ellis, General Relativity: An Einstein Centenary Survey, with W. Israel, and 300 Years of Gravity, with W. Israel.

367,The Hour I First Believed,The Hour I First Believed,,Hardcover,Wally Lamb,740,"Wally Lamb's two previous novels, <i>She's Come Undone</i> and <i>I Know This Much Is True,</i> struck a chord with readers. They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. <p>In <i>The Hour I First Believed,</i> Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.</p><p>When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues. </p><p>While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface. </p><p>As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary -- and American.</p><p><i>The Hour I First Believed</i> is a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.</p>",3.81,5:15068|4:19598|3:13171|2:4232|1:1231|total:53300,48680,5814,2008,Harper,en-US,FALSE,60393491,60393491,1999,2000,3086160,3086160,3811636,32,60393491,9.78006E+12,Wally Lamb,2007,The Hour I First Believed,The Hour I First Believed,en-US,3.8,46475,50586,6180,1214,4088,12596,18566,14122,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,204,The Hour I First Believed,60393491,,US$ 3.75,"['Denver, Colorado', 'Connecticut']",,Wally Lamb,12,male,"Wally Lamb is the author of She's Come Undone, The Hour I First Believed, and I Know This Much Is True.

Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community.

374,Alexander Hamilton,Alexander Hamilton,,Paperback,Ron Chernow,818,"Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.<br /><br />In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, <b>
  <i>Alexander Hamilton</i>
</b> is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”<br /><br />Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.<br /><br />Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, <b>

With a breadth &amp; depth matched by no other one-volume life, this crisply paced narrative carries readers thru his troubled boyhood, his precocious feats in the French &amp; Indian War, his creation of Mt Vernon, his heroic exploits with the Continental Army, his presiding over the Constitutional Convention &amp; his performance as the 1st president. Despite the reverence his name inspires, Washington remains a lifeless waxwork for many, worthy but dull. A laconic man of granite self-control, he often arouses more respect than affection. This work, based on massive research, dashes the stereotype of a stolid, unemotional man. A strapping 6', Washington was a celebrated horseman, elegant dancer &amp; tireless hunter, with a fiercely guarded emotional life. Chernow brings to vivid life a dashing, passionate man of fiery opinions &amp; many moods. Probing his private life, he explores his fraught relationship with his crusty mother, his youthful infatuation with the married Sally Fairfax &amp; his often conflicted feelings toward his adopted children &amp; grandchildren. He also provides a portrait of his marriage to Martha &amp; his complex behavior as a slave master. At the same time this is an astute portrait of a canny politician who knew how to inspire people. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age, including Madison, Hamilton, Adams &amp; Jefferson, but he also orchestrated their actions to shape the new federal government, define the separation of powers &amp; establish the office of the presidency. This biography takes us on a page-turning journey thru the formative events of America's founding. With a dramatic sweep worthy of its subject, this is a magisterial work from an elegant storyteller.",4.07,5:18602|4:13294|3:6008|2:2016|1:1868|total:41788,39440,1635,2010,Penguin Press,eng,FALSE,1594202664,1594202664,3420,3421,8255917,8255917,13103688,26,1594202664,9.78159E+12,Ron Chernow,2010,Washington: A Life,Washington: A Life,eng,4.09,28598,30023,1414,1149,1207,4525,9990,13152,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348969179m/8255917.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348969179s/8255917.jpg,1514,Washington: A Life,1594202664,,US$ 11.70,,['Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography (2011)'],Ron Chernow,10,male,"<b>Ron Chernow</b> was born in 1949 in Brooklyn, New York.

In ""Home,"" a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antique store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of <i>Tenth of December</i> are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders' signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.<br /><br />Writing brilliantly and profoundly about class, sex, love, loss, work, despair, and war, Saunders cuts to the core of the contemporary experience.

384,Lincoln in the Bardo,Lincoln in the Bardo,,Hardcover,George Saunders,343,"In his long-awaited first novel, American master George Saunders delivers his most original, transcendent, and moving work yet. Unfolding in a graveyard over the course of a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices, Lincoln in the Bardo is a literary experience unlike any other—for no one but Saunders could conceive it.<br /><br />February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. “My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returned to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy’s body.<br /><br />From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a thrilling, supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory, where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul.<br /><br />Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices—living and dead, historical and invented—to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?",3.78,5:29636|4:28608|3:17825|2:8322|1:4891|total:89282,71557,12853,2017,Random House,eng,FALSE,812995341,812995341,9391,9392,29906980,29906980,50281866,2,812995341,9.78081E+12,George Saunders,2017,Lincoln in the Bardo,Lincoln in the Bardo,eng,3.93,20373,24013,5354,996,1809,4186,7887,9135,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492130850m/29906980.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492130850s/29906980.jpg,807,Lincoln in the Bardo,812995341,['Abraham Lincoln'],US$ 5.77,"['Washington, D.C.']","['Man Booker Prize (2017)', 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) Nominee for International Book (2018)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2017)', 'Waterstones Book of the Year Nominee (2017)', 'Gordon Burn Prize Nominee for Longlist (2017)', 'Golden Man Booker Prize Nominee (2018)']",George Saunders,91,male,"George Saunders was born December 2, 1958 and raised on the south side of Chicago.

Once there, she faces the trials of adolescence far from her friends and family, and while she soon carves out a place for herself among a group of fellow outsiders, she continues to struggle for a sense of belonging.<br /><br /><br /><br />Finding that she misses her home more than she can stand, Marjane returns to Iran after graduation. Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria.

However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.<br /><br />As funny and poignant as its predecessor, <i>Persepolis 2</i> is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism.

According to Persepolis, one Scud hit the house next to hers, killing her friend and entire family.<br /><br />Satrapi's family are of distant Iranian Azeri ancestry and are descendants of Nasser al-Din Shah, Shah of Persia from 1848 until 1896. Satrapi said that ""But you have to know the kings of the Qajar dynasty, they had hundreds of wives. They made thousands of kids. If you multiply these kids by generation you have, I don't know, 10-15,000 princes [and princesses]. There's nothing extremely special about that."" She added that due to this detail, most Iranian families would be, in the words of Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian, ""blue blooded.""<br /><br />In 1983, at the age of 14 Satrapi was sent to Vienna, Austria by her parents in order to flee the Iranian regime. There she attended the Lycée Français de Vienne. According to her autobiographical graphic novel, Persepolis, she stayed in Vienna through her high school years, staying in friends' homes, but spent three months living on the streets. After an almost deadly bout of pneumonia, she returned to Iran. She studied Visual Communication, eventually obtaining a Master's Degree from Islamic Azad University in Tehran.<br /><br />During this time, Satrapi went to numerous illegal parties hosted by her friends, where she met a man named Reza, a veteran of the Iran-Iraq War. She married him at the age of 21, but divorced roughly three years later. Satrapi then moved to Strasbourg, France.",11/22/1969,Alive,Unknown

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.<br /><br />In the international bestseller <i>Blue Ocean Strategy</i>, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating ""blue oceans""—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.<br /><br /><i>Blue Ocean Strategy</i> presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

394,American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,,Hardcover,Jon Meacham,483,"<b>The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington forever</b><br /><br />Andrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson's election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.<br /><br />One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.<br /><br />Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.",3.78,5:10456|4:13954|3:9031|2:2636|1:1415|total:37492,36295,1399,2008,Random House,eng,FALSE,1400063256,1400063256,2789,2790,3147367,3147367,3178858,17,1400063256,9.7814E+12,Jon Meacham,2008,American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,en-US,3.76,32564,33439,1378,1309,2419,8198,12414,9099,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320480904m/3147367.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320480904s/3147367.jpg,2837,American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,1400063256,"['John Quincy Adams', 'Daniel Webster', 'Andrew Jackson', 'John C.

This is the beginning of her story, her legend, and her legacy....<br /><br />Beka Cooper is a rookie with the law-enforcing Provost's Guard, commonly known as ""the Provost's Dogs,"" in Corus, the capital city of Tortall. To the surprise of both the veteran ""Dogs"" and her fellow ""puppies,"" Beka requests duty in the Lower City. The Lower City is a tough beat. But it's also where Beka was born, and she's comfortable there.<br /><br />Beka gets her wish. She's assigned to work with Mattes and Clary, famed veterans among the Provost's Dogs. They're tough, they're capable, and they're none too happy about the indignity of being saddled with a puppy for the first time in years. What they don't know is that Beka has something unique to offer. Never much of a talker, Beka is a good listener. So good, in fact, that she hears things that Mattes and Clary never could - information that is passed in murmurs when flocks of pigeons gather ... murmurs that are the words of the dead.<br /><br />In this way, Beka learns of someone in the Lower City who has overturned the power structure of the underworld and is terrorizing its citizens into submission and silence. Beka's magical listening talent is the only way for the Provost's Dogs to find out the identity of this brutal new underlord, for the dead are beyond fear. And the ranks of the dead will be growing if the Dogs can't stop a crime wave the likes of which has never been seen. Luckily for the people of the Lower City, the new puppy is a true terrier!",4.16,5:25992|4:17399|3:8400|2:2139|1:1467|total:55397,53260,1547,2006,Random House,eng,FALSE,037581468X,037581468X,2801,2802,13829,13829,3056999,23,037581468X,9.78038E+12,Tamora Pierce,2006,Terrier,"Terrier (Beka Cooper, #1)",eng,4.16,48028,49845,1594,1282,1973,7618,15689,23283,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398029898m/13829.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398029898s/13829.jpg,1301,"Terrier (Beka Cooper, #1)",037581468X,['Beka Cooper'],US$ 4.21,['Tortall'],"[""Mythopoeic Fantasy Award Nominee for Children's Literature (2012)"", ""West Australian Young Readers' Book Award (WAYRBA) for Older Readers (2009)"", 'Missouri Gateway Readers Award Nominee (2009)']",Tamora Pierce,88,female,"Hey, folks!

Beka's natural skills of observation and tenacity are augmented by her unusual magical talents, which allow her to gather information both from pigeons are from the eddies of dirt and dust that swirl on street corners. But even her magic isn't very useful when unrest comes to Tortall's capital in the form of counterfeit coins, which turn up in shops all over the city.

With <i>Assassination Vacation,</i> she takes us on a road trip like no other—a journey to the pit stops of American political murder and through the myriad ways they have been used for fun and profit, for political and cultural advantage.<br /><br />From Buffalo to Alaska, Washington to the Dry Tortugas, Vowell visits locations immortalized and influenced by the spilling of politically important blood, reporting as she goes with her trademark blend of wisecracking humor, remarkable honesty, and thought-provoking criticism. We learn about the jinx that was Robert Todd Lincoln (present at the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) and witness the politicking that went into the making of the Lincoln Memorial. The resulting narrative is much more than an entertaining and informative travelogue—it is the disturbing and fascinating story of how American death has been manipulated by popular culture, including literature, architecture, sculpture, and—the author's favorite— historical tourism. Though the themes of loss and violence are explored and we make detours to see how the Republican Party became the Republican Party, there are all kinds of lighter diversions along the way into the lives of the three presidents and their assassins, including mummies, show tunes, mean-spirited totem poles, and a nineteenth-century biblical sex cult.",3.98,5:11882|4:15319|3:7494|2:1724|1:621|total:37040,34868,3293,2006,Simon  Schuster,eng,FALSE,074326004X,074326004X,2896,2897,3110,3110,824686,18,074326004X,9.78074E+12,Sarah Vowell,2005,Assassination Vacation,Assassination Vacation,en-US,3.98,32176,34125,3408,523,1545,6889,14274,10894,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,203,Assassination Vacation,074326004X,"['Abraham Lincoln', 'John Wilkes Booth', 'Edwin Booth', 'Theodore Roosevelt', 'William McKinley', '...more', 'James A.

Vowell received the Music Journalism Award in 1996.<br /><br />Vowell is a New York Times’ bestselling author of five nonfiction books on American history and culture. Her most recent book is <u>Unfamiliar Fishes</u> (2011), which reviews the takeover of Hawaii's property and politics first by white missionaries from the United States and later joined by American plantation growers, ultimately resulting in a Coup d'état, restricted voting rights for nonwhites, and forced statehood for the small chain of islands. Her earlier book, <u>The Wordy Shipmates</u> (2008), examines the New England Puritans and their journey to and impact on America. She studies John Winthrop’s 1630 sermon “A Model of Christian Charity” – and the bloody story that resulted from American exceptionalism. And she also traces the relationship of Winthrop, Massachusetts’ first governor, and Roger Williams, the Calvinist minister who founded Rhode Island – an unlikely friendship that was emblematic of the polar extremes of the American foundation. Throughout, she reveals how American history can show up in the most unexpected places in our modern culture, often in unexpected ways.<br /><br />Her book <u>Assassination Vacation</u> (2005) describes a road trip to tourist sites devoted to the murders of presidents Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. Vowell examines what these acts of political violence reveal about our national character and our contemporary society.<br /><br />She is also the author of two essay collections, <u>The Partly Cloudy Patriot</u> (2002) and <u>Take the Cannoli</u> (2000).

402,The Wordy Shipmates,The Wordy Shipmates,,,Sarah Vowell,272,"<i>The Wordy Shipmates</i> is <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Sarah Vowell's exploration of the Puritans and their journey to America to become the people of John Winthrop's ""city upon a hill""—a shining example, a ""city that cannot be hid.""<br /><br />To this day, America views itself as a Puritan nation, but Vowell investigates what that means—and what it should mean. What was this great political enterprise all about? Who were these people who are considered the philosophical, spiritual, and moral ancestors of our nation? What Vowell discovers is something far different from what their uptight shoe-buckles-and-corn reputation might suggest. The people she finds are highly literate, deeply principled, and surprisingly feisty. Their story is filled with pamphlet feuds, witty courtroom dramas, and bloody vengeance. Along the way she asks:<br /><br />Was Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop a communitarian, Christlike Christian, or conformity's tyrannical enforcer? <i>Yes!</i> <br /><br />Was Rhode Island's architect Roger Williams America's founding freak or the father of the First Amendment? <i>Same difference</i>. <br /><br />What does it take to get that jezebel Anne Hutchinson to shut up? <i>A hatchet</i>. <br /><br />What was the Puritans' pet name for the Pope? <i>The Great Whore of Babylon</i>. <br /><br />Sarah Vowell's special brand of armchair history makes the bizarre and esoteric fascinatingly relevant and fun.

Only partly recognizing this place of his cultured, middle-class youth, he is even more disoriented by news of strange events in the wider country: a wave of suicides among girls forbidden to wear their head scarves at school. An apparent thaw of his writer's curiosity–a frozen sea these many years–leads him to Kars, a far-off town near the Russian border and the epicenter of the suicides. <br /><br />No sooner has he arrived, however, than we discover that Ka's motivations are not purely journalistic; for in Kars, once a province of Ottoman and then Russian glory, now a cultural gray-zone of poverty and paralysis, there is also Ipek, a radiant friend of Ka's youth, lately divorced, whom he has never forgotten. As a snowstorm, the fiercest in memory, descends on the town and seals it off from the modern, westernized world that has always been Ka's frame of reference, he finds himself drawn in unexpected directions: not only headlong toward the unknowable Ipek and the desperate hope for love–or at least a wife–that she embodies, but also into the maelstrom of a military coup staged to restrain the local Islamist radicals, and even toward God, whose existence Ka has never before allowed himself to contemplate. In this surreal confluence of emotion and spectacle, Ka begins to tap his dormant creative powers, producing poem after poem in untimely, irresistible bursts of inspiration. But not until the snows have melted and the political violence has run its bloody course will Ka discover the fate of his bid to seize a last chance for happiness. <br /><br />Blending profound sympathy and mischievous wit, Snow illuminates the contradictions gripping the individual and collective heart in many parts of the Muslim world.

As he writes in his autobiographical book Istanbul, from his childhood until the age of 22 he devoted himself largely to painting and dreamed of becoming an artist. After graduating from the secular American Robert College in Istanbul, he studied architecture at Istanbul Technical University for three years, but abandoned the course when he gave up his ambition to become an architect and artist. He went on to graduate in journalism from Istanbul University, but never worked as a journalist. At the age of 23 Pamuk decided to become a novelist, and giving up everything else retreated into his flat and began to write.<br /><br />His first novel <i>Cevdet Bey and His Sons</i> was published seven years later in 1982. The novel is the story of three generations of a wealthy Istanbul family living in Nisantasi, Pamuk's own home district. The novel was awarded both the Orhan Kemal and Milliyet literary prizes. The following year Pamuk published his novel <i>The Silent House</i>, which in French translation won the 1991 Prix de la découverte européene. <i>The White Castle</i> (1985) about the frictions and friendship between a Venetian slave and an Ottoman scholar was published in English and many other languages from 1990 onwards, bringing Pamuk his first international fame. The same year Pamuk went to America, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York from 1985 to 1988. It was there that he wrote most of his novel <i>The Black Book</i>, in which the streets, past, chemistry and texture of Istanbul are described through the story of a lawyer seeking his missing wife. This novel was published in Turkey in 1990, and the French translation won the Prix France Culture. <i>The Black Book</i> enlarged Pamuk's fame both in Turkey and internationally as an author at once popular and experimental, and able to write about past and present with the same intensity. In 1991 Pamuk's daughter Rüya was born. That year saw the production of a film Hidden Face, whose script by Pamuk was based on a one-page story in <i>The Black Book</i>.<br /><br />His novel <i>The New Life</i>, about young university students influenced by a mysterious book, was published in Turkey in 1994 and became one of the most widely read books in Turkish literature. <i>My Name Is Red</i>, about Ottoman and Persian artists and their ways of seeing and portraying the non-western world, told through a love story and family story, was published in 1998. This novel won the French Prix du meilleur livre étranger, the Italian Grinzane Cavour (2002) and the International IMPAC Dublin literary award (2003). From the mid-1990s Pamuk took a critical stance towards the Turkish state in articles about human rights and freedom of thought, although he took little interest in politics. <i>Snow</i>, which he describes as “my first and last political novel” was published in 2002. In this book set in the small city of Kars in northeastern Turkey he experimented with a new type of “political novel”, telling the story of violence and tension between political Islamists, soldiers, secularists, and Kurdish and Turkish nationalists. <i>Snow</i> was selected as one of the best 100 books of 2004 by The New York Times. In 1999 a selection of his articles on literature and culture written for newspapers and magazines in Turkey and abroad, together with a selection of writings from his private notebooks, was published under the title <i>Other Colours</i>. Pamuk's most recent book, Istanbul, is a poetical work that is hard to classify, combining the author's early memoirs up to the age of 22, and an essay about the city of Istanbul, illustrated with photographs from his own album, and pictures by western painters and Turkish photographers.",6/7/1952,Alive,13

Similar in plotting to books such as On the Beach and Alas Babylon, One Second After, is set in a small college town in western North Carolina and is a cautionary tale of the collapse of social order in the wake of an EMP strike. The book has been optioned by Warner Bros. and currently is in development as a feature film. The book was cited on the floor of Congress and before the House Armed Services Committee by Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R.-MD), chair of the House Committee tasked to evaluate EMP weapons, as a realistical portrayal of the potential damage rendered by an EMP attack on the continental United States.<br /><br />Forstchen resides near Asheville, North Carolina with his daughter Meghan. His other interests include archaeology, and he has participated in several expeditions to Mongolia and Russia. He is a pilot and co owns an original 1943 Aeronca L-3B recon plane used in World War II.<br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://us.macmillan.com/author/williamrforstchen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.macmillan.com/author/willia...</a>",10/11/1950,Alive,Unknown

Leopold Bloom King, our narrator, is the son of an amiable, loving father who teaches science at the local high school. His mother, an ex-nun, is the high school principal and a well-known Joyce scholar. After Leo's older brother commits suicide at the age of thirteen, the family struggles with the shattering effects of his death, and Leo, lonely and isolated, searches for something to sustain him. Eventually, he finds his answer when he becomes part of a tightly knit group of high school seniors that includes friends Sheba and Trevor Poe, glamorous twins with an alcoholic mother and a prison-escapee father; hardscrabble mountain runaways Niles and Starla Whitehead; socialite Molly Huger and her boyfriend, Chadworth Rutledge X; and an ever-widening circle whose liaisons will ripple across two decades-from 1960s counterculture through the dawn of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. <br /><br />The ties among them endure for years, surviving marriages happy and troubled, unrequited loves and unspoken longings, hard-won successes and devastating breakdowns, and Charleston's dark legacy of racism and class divisions. But the final test of friendship that brings them to San Francisco is something no one is prepared for.

In her new home Honor discovers that principles count for little, even within a religious community meant to be committed to human equality. <br /><br />However, drawn into the clandestine activities of the Underground Railroad, a network helping runaway slaves escape to freedom, Honor befriends two surprising women who embody the remarkable power of defiance. Eventually she must decide if she too can act on what she believes in, whatever the personal costs. <br /><br />A powerful journey brimming with color and drama, The Last Runaway is Tracy Chevalier’s vivid engagement with an iconic part of American history.",3.8,5:5906|4:11913|3:7389|2:1512|1:330|total:27050,23102,3192,2013,E.P.

432,Marie Antoinette: The Journey,Marie Antoinette: The Journey,,Paperback,Antonia Fraser,512,"Brilliantly written, a work of impeccable scholarship. An utterly riveting and intensely moving book by one of our finest biographers.<br /><br />Never before has the life of Marie Antoinette been told so intimately and with such authority as in Antonia Fraser's newest work, Marie Antoinette: The Journey. Famously known as the eighteenth-century French queen whose excesses have become legend, Marie Antoinette was blamed for instigating the French Revolution. But the story of her journey begun as a fourteen-year-old sent from Vienna to marry the future Louis XVI to her courageous defense before she was sent to the guillotine reveals a woman of greater complexity and character than we have previously understood. We stand beside Marie Antoinette and witness the drama of her life as she becomes a scapegoat of the Ancien Regime when her faults were minor in comparison to the punishments inflicted on her.<br /><br />The youngest daughter, fifteenth out of sixteen children, of Austrian empress Maria Teresa and Francis I, Marie Antoinette was sent on a literal journey by her mother from Vienna to Versailles with the expectation that she would further Austrian interests at all times. Yet, Marie Antoinette was by nature far from interested in state affairs and much more inclined to exert a gracious, philanthropic role, patronizing the arts especially music, as royalty would come to behave in the nineteenth century. Despite this the French accused her of political interference and wrote scandalous tracts against her, mocking her lack of sophistication. Meanwhile, longing for a family and the birth of an heir who would have cemented the Franco-Austro alliance, the French queen had to endure more than eight years of public humiliation for her barren marriage before the delivery of her first of four children.<br /><br />As these problems unfold, Antonia Fraser also weaves a richly detailed account of Marie Antoinette's other, more poignant journey: from the ill-educated and unprepared girl who sought refuge in pleasure as a consolation into a magnificent, courageous woman who defied her enemies at her trial with consummate intelligence, arousing the admiration of even the most hostile revolutionaries.<br /><br />Brilliantly written, Marie Antoinette is a work of impeccable scholarship. Drawing on a wealth of family letters and other archival materials, Antonia Fraser successfully avoids the hagiography of some the French queen's admirers and the misogyny of many of her critics. The result is an utterly riveting and intensely moving book by one of our finest biographers.",3.92,5:9308|4:10267|3:6521|2:1471|1:697|total:28264,25683,774,2006,Anchor Books,eng,FALSE,307277747,307277747,3555,3556,17157,17157,1850916,55,307277747,9.78031E+12,Antonia Fraser,2001,Marie Antoinette: The Journey,Marie Antoinette: The Journey,en-US,3.91,24158,26393,1029,625,1401,6212,9588,8567,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,501,Marie Antoinette: The Journey,307277747,['Marie Antoinette'],US$ 3.78,['France'],['Los Angeles Times Book Prize'],Antonia Fraser,98,female,"Antonia Fraser is the author of many widely acclaimed historical works, including the biographies Mary, Queen of Scots (a 40th anniversary edition was published in May 2009), Cromwell: Our Chief of Men, King Charles II and The Gunpowder Plot (CWA Non-Fiction Gold Dagger; St Louis Literary Award).

435,Indignation,Indignation,,Hardcover,Philip Roth,233,"Against the backdrop of the Korean War, a young man faces life’s unimagined chances and terrifying consequences.<br /><br />It is 1951 in America, the second year of the Korean War. A studious, law-abiding, intense youngster from Newark, New Jersey, Marcus Messner, is beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral, conservative campus of Ohio’s Winesburg College. And why is he there and not at the local college in Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, hard-working neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad -- mad with fear and apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, the dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy.<br /><br />As the long-suffering, desperately harassed mother tells her son, the father’s fear arises from love and pride. Perhaps, but it produces too much anger in Marcus for him to endure living with his parents any longer. He leaves them and, far from Newark, in the midwestern college, has to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another American world.<br /><br /><i>Indignation</i>, Philip Roth’s twenty-ninth book, is a story of inexperience, foolishness, intellectual resistance, sexual discovery, courage, and error. It is a story told with all the inventive energy and wit Roth has at his command, at once a startling departure from the haunted narratives of old age and experience in his recent books and a powerful addition to his investigations of the impact of American history on the life of the vulnerable individual.",3.71,5:2475|4:5438|3:3742|2:893|1:199|total:12747,9697,990,2008,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,eng,FALSE,054705484X,054705484X,9262,9263,3015764,3015764,3046305,93,054705484X,9.78055E+12,Philip Roth,2008,Indignation,Indignation,eng,3.69,8585,10831,1191,185,808,3228,4575,2035,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1404,Indignation,054705484X,['Marcus Messner'],US$ 4.04,"['Newark, New Jersey', 'New Jersey']",['Κρατικό Βραβείο Λογοτεχνικής Μετάφρασης for Μετάφραση Έργου Ξένης Λογοτεχνίας στην Ελληνική Γλώσσα (2010)'],Philip Roth,140,male,"Philip Milton Roth was an American novelist.

Nicknamed ""Zippy"" for the way she would bolt around the house, this small girl was possessed of big eyes and even bigger ears. In this witty and lovingly told memoir, Kimmel takes readers back to a time when small-town America was caught in the amber of the innocent postwar period—people helped their neighbors, went to church on Sunday, and kept barnyard animals in their backyards.<br /><br />To three-year-old Zippy, it made perfect sense to strike a bargain with her father to keep her baby bottle—never mind that when she did, it was the first time she'd ever spoken. In her nonplussed family, Zippy has the perfect supporting cast: her beautiful yet dour brother, Danny, a seeker of the true faith; her sweetly sensible sister, Lindy, who wins the local beauty pageant; her mother, Delonda, who dispenses wisdom from the corner of the couch; and her father, Bob Jarvis, who never met a bet he didn't like.<br /><br />Whether describing a serious case of chicken love, another episode with the evil Edythe across the street, or the night Zippy's dad borrowed thirty-six coon dogs and a raccoon to prove to the complaining neighbors just how quiet his two dogs were, Kimmel treats readers to a heroine who is wonderfully sweet and shy as she navigates the quirky adult world surrounding Zippy.",3.79,5:8933|4:11638|3:8669|2:2397|1:717|total:32354,29636,3290,2001,Doubleday,eng,FALSE,965030067,965030067,3567,3568,15171,15171,17077,23,965030067,9.78097E+12,Haven Kimmel,2001,"A Girl Named Zippy: Growing up Small in Mooreland, Indiana ",A Girl Named Zippy,,3.79,27928,30263,3487,667,2258,8151,10858,8329,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1334082673m/15171.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1334082673s/15171.jpg,1850,A Girl Named Zippy,965030067,,US$ 3.98,['United States of America'],,Haven Kimmel,10,Unknown,"Haven Kimmel was born in New Castle, Indiana, and was raised in Mooreland, Indiana, the focus of her bestselling memoir, <i>A Girl Named Zippy: Growing up Small in Mooreland, Indiana </i>.<br /><br />Kimmel earned her undergraduate degree in English and creative writing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana and a graduate degree from North Carolina State University, where she studied with novelist Lee Smith.

She called it ""disaster capitalism."" Covering Sri Lanka in the wake of the tsunami, and New Orleans post-Katrina, she witnessed something remarkably similar. People still reeling from catastrophe were being hit again, this time with economic ""shock treatment"" losing their land and homes to rapid-fire corporate makeovers. The Shock Doctrine retells the story of the most dominant ideology of our time, Milton Friedman's free market economic revolution. In contrast to the popular myth of this movement's peaceful global victory, Klein shows how it has exploited moments of shock and extreme violence in order to implement its economic policies in so many parts of the world from Latin America and Eastern Europe to South Africa, Russia, and Iraq. At the core of disaster capitalism is the use of cataclysmic events to advance radical privatization combined with the privatization of the disaster response itself. By capitalizing on crises, created by nature or war, Klein argues that the disaster capitalism complex now exists as a booming new economy, and is the violent culmination of a radical economic project that has been incubating for fifty years.",4.23,5:15401|4:10866|3:4186|2:1113|1:568|total:32134,28320,1950,2007,Metropolitan Books,eng,FALSE,805079831,805079831,3585,3586,1237300,1237300,2826418,67,805079831,9.78081E+12,Naomi Klein,2006,The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,en-US,4.22,24111,27056,2120,448,929,3616,9230,12833,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,725,The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,805079831,"['Augusto Pinochet', 'Milton Friedman', 'Ewen Cameron', 'Margaret Thatcher', 'Lech Wałęsa', '...more', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'Vladimir Lenin', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'Hajji Suharto', 'Nelson Mandela', 'Thabo Mbeki', 'Jeffrey Sachs', '...less']",US$ 4.21,"['New Orleans, Louisiana', 'Chile', 'Argentina', 'Uruguay', 'Bolivia', 'Brazil', 'United Kingdom', 'Indonesia', 'Russia', 'South Africa', 'Iraq', 'Sri Lanka']","['Warwick Prize for Writing (2009)', 'Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Non‐Fiction Book (2008)', 'British Columbia National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction Nominee (2008)']",Naomi Klein,54,female,"<div>Naomi Klein is an award-winning journalist, syndicated columnist, documentary filmmaker and author of the international bestsellers <em>No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies</em>, <em>The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism</em> and <em>This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate</em>.

444,The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,,Paperback,Neil Strauss,431,"Whiskey and porn stars, hot reds and car crashes, black leather and high heels, overdoses and death. This is the life of Mötley Crüe, the heaviest drinking, hardest fighting, most oversexed and arrogant band in the world. Their unbelievable exploits are the stuff of rock 'n' roll legend. They nailed the hottest chicks, started the bloodiest fights, partied with the biggest drug dealers, and got to know the inside of every jail cell from California to Japan. They have dedicated an entire career to living life to its extreme, from the greatest fantasies to the darkest tragedies. Tommy married two international sex symbols; Vince killed a man and lost a daughter to cancer; Nikki overdosed, rose from the dead, and then OD'd again the next day; and Mick shot a woman and tried to hang his own brother. But that's just the beginning. Fueled by every drug they could get their hands on and obscene amounts of alcohol, driven by fury and headed straight for hell, Mötley Crüe raged through two decades, leaving behind a trail of debauched women, trashed hotel rooms, crashed cars, psychotic managers, and broken bones that has left the music industry cringing to this day. All these unspeakable acts, not to mention their dire consequences, are laid bare in <i>The Dirt.</i><br /><br />Here -- directly from Nikki, Vince, Tommy, and Mick -- is the unexpurgated version of the whole glorious, gut-wrenching story. In these pages, published for the first time anywhere, are Tommy Lee's letters to Pamela Anderson from prison: Mick's confession to having an incurable disease that is slowly killing him; Vince's experience burying his own daughter -- and the train wreck that his life became afterward; and Nikki's anguished struggle to deal with an entire life fueled by anger over his childhood abandonment, his discovery of the family he never knew he had -- and his subsequent loss of them. And all of it accompanied by scores of rare, never-before-published photographs, mug shots, and handwritten lyrics. No one is spared. Not David Lee Roth, Ozzy Osbourne, Vanity, Aerosmith, Heather Locklear, AC/DC, Lita Ford, Iron Maiden, Pamela Anderson, Guns N' Roses, Donna D'Errico, RATT, or those two girls from Dallas, Texas.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it: these guys are geniuses. They invented glam metal and then left it in the dust; sold more than forty million albums from <i>Shout at the Devil</i> to <i>Dr. Feelgood;</i> toured the world dozen times and have the scars to prove it; and maintained a rabid following in an era of throwaway pop stars. Mötley Crüe has done nothing less than tattoo the psyche of the entire MTV generation. They are the ultimate rock 'n' roll band.

The year is 1915 and she has volunteered on behalf of the Boston-based Friends of Armenia to help deliver food and medical aid to refugees of the Armenian genocide.

447,The Double Bind,The Double Bind,,Hardcover,Chris Bohjalian,384,"In Chris Bohjalian's astonishing novel, nothing is what it at first seems. Not the bucolic Vermont back roads college sophomore Laurel Estabrook likes to bike. Not the savage assault she suffers toward the end of one of her rides. And certainly not Bobbie Crocker, the elderly man with a history of mental illness whom Laurel comes to know through her work at a Burlington homeless shelter in the years subsequent to the attack.<br /><br />In his moments of lucidity, the gentle, likable Bobbie alludes to his earlier life as a successful photographer. Laurel finds it hard to believe that this destitute, unstable man could once have chronicled the lives of musicians and celebrities, but a box of photographs and negatives discovered among Bobbie's meager possessions after his death lends credence to his tale. How could such an accomplished man have fallen on such hard times? Becoming obsessed with uncovering Bobbie's past, Laurel studies his photographs, tracking down every lead they provide into the mystery of his life before homelessness -- including links to the rich neighborhoods of her own Long Island childhood and to the earlier world of F. Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby,</i> with its larger-than-life characters, elusive desires, and haunting sorrows.<br /><br />In a narrative of dazzling invention, literary ingenuity, and psychological complexity, Bohjalian engages issues of homelessness and mental illness by evoking the humanity that inhabits the core of both. At the same time, his tale is fast-paced and riveting -- <i>The Double Bind</i> combines the suspense of a thriller with the emotional depths of the most intimate drama. The breathtaking surprises of its final pages will leave readers stunned, overwhelmed by the poignancy of life's fleeting truths, as caught in Bobbie Crocker's photographs and in Laurel Estabrook's painful pursuit of Bobbie's past -- and her own. <br /><br /><br /><b>Behind <i>The Double Bind</i></b><br /><br />While Bobbie Crocker, the photographer in <i>The Double Bind,</i> is fictitious, the photographs that appear in the book are real. They were taken by a man named Bob ""Soupy"" Campbell, who, as Chris Bohaljian explains in his Author's Note, ""had gone from photographing luminaries from the 1950s and 1960s to winding up at a homeless shelter in northern Vermont."" <br /><br />Bohaljian's viewing of Campbell's work after the photographer's death provided an inspiration for <i>The Double Bind</i>. ""We tend to stigmatize the homeless and blame them for their plight,"" Bohjalian writes. <br /><br />""We are oblivious to the fact that most had lives as serious as our own before everything fell apart. The photographs in this book are a testimony to that reality.""",3.62,5:5212|4:9613|3:7375|2:2472|1:826|total:25498,23531,3435,2007,Crown,eng,FALSE,1400047463,1400047463,4837,4838,126807,126807,122117,37,1400047463,9.7814E+12,Chris Bohjalian,2007,The Double Bind,The Double Bind,eng,3.62,22067,23773,3551,783,2346,6910,8931,4803,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,2572,The Double Bind,1400047463,,US$ 3.62,,,Chris Bohjalian,25,male,"Follow Chris Bohjalian on Goodreads to see what's on the nightstand!<br /><br />Chris is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of 20 books.

451,Teacher Man ,"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)","Frank McCourt, #3",Paperback,Frank McCourt,272,"McCourt's long-awaited book about how his thirty-year teaching career shaped his second act as a writer.<br /><br />Nearly a decade ago Frank McCourt became an unlikely star when, at the age of sixty-six, he burst onto the literary scene with Angela's Ashes, the Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of his childhood in Limerick, Ireland. Then came 'Tis, his glorious account of his early years in New York.<br /><br />Now, here at last, is McCourt's long-awaited book about how his thirty-year teaching career shaped his second act as a writer. Teacher Man is also an urgent tribute to teachers everywhere. In bold and spirited prose featuring his irreverent wit and heartbreaking honesty, McCourt records the trials, triumphs and surprises he faces in public high schools around New York City. His methods anything but conventional, McCourt creates a lasting impact on his students through imaginative assignments (he instructs one class to write ""An Excuse Note from Adam or Eve to God""), singalongs (featuring recipe ingredients as lyrics), and field trips (imagine taking twenty-nine rowdy girls to a movie in Times Square!).<br /><br />McCourt struggles to find his way in the classroom and spends his evenings drinking with writers and dreaming of one day putting his own story to paper. Teacher Man shows McCourt developing his unparalleled ability to tell a great story as, five days a week, five periods per day, he works to gain the attention and respect of unruly, hormonally charged or indifferent adolescents. McCourt's rocky marriage, his failed attempt to get a Ph.D. at Trinity College, Dublin, and his repeated firings due to his propensity to talk back to his superiors ironically lead him to New York's most prestigious school, Stuyvesant High School, where he finally finds a place and a voice. ""Doggedness,"" he says, is ""not as glamorous as ambition or talent or intellect or charm, but still the one thing that got me through the days and nights.""<br /><br />For McCourt, storytelling itself is the source of salvation, and in Teacher Man the journey to redemption -- and literary fame -- is an exhilarating adventure.",3.74,5:6657|4:10597|3:8502|2:2065|1:421|total:28242,25454,1968,2006,Scribner,eng,FALSE,743243781,743243781,3965,3966,4909,4909,3060322,71,743243781,9.78074E+12,Frank McCourt,2005,Teacher Man,"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)",en-CA,3.73,23736,26183,2065,398,1970,7967,9765,6083,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,330,"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)",743243781,['Frank McCourt'],US$ 3.58,['United States of America'],['Audie Award for Biography/Memoir (2007)'],Frank McCourt,49,male,"Francis ""Frank"" McCourt was an Irish-American teacher and author.

I am to die when I have hardly begun to live.<br /><br /> Historical expertise marries page-turning fiction in Alison Weir’s enthralling debut novel, breathing new life into one of the most significant and tumultuous periods of the English monarchy. It is the story of Lady Jane Grey–“the Nine Days’ Queen” –a fifteen-year-old girl who unwittingly finds herself at the center of the religious and civil unrest that nearly toppled the fabled House of Tudor during the sixteenth century.<br /><br /> The child of a scheming father and a ruthless mother, for whom she is merely a pawn in a dynastic game with the highest stakes, Jane Grey was born during the harrowingly turbulent period between Anne Boleyn’s beheading and the demise of Jane’s infamous great-uncle, King Henry VIII. With the premature passing of Jane’ s adolescent cousin, and Henry’s successor, King Edward VI, comes a struggle for supremacy fueled by political machinations and lethal religious fervor. <br /><br /> Unabashedly honest and exceptionally intelligent, Jane possesses a sound strength of character beyond her years that equips her to weather the vicious storm. And though she has no ambitions to rule, preferring to immerse herself in books and religious studies, she is forced to accept the crown, and by so doing sets off a firestorm of intrigue, betrayal, and tragedy.<br /><br /> Alison Weir uses her unmatched skills as a historian to enliven the many dynamic characters of this majestic drama. Along with Lady Jane Grey, Weir vividly renders her devious parents; her much-loved nanny; the benevolent Queen Katherine Parr; Jane’s ambitious cousins; the Catholic “Bloody” Mary, who will stop at nothing to seize the throne; and the Protestant and future queen Elizabeth. Readers venture inside royal drawing rooms and bedchambers to witness the power-grabbing that swirls around Lady Jane Grey from the day of her birth to her unbearably poignant death. Innocent Traitor paints a complete and compelling portrait of this captivating young woman, a faithful servant of God whose short reign and brief life would make her a legend.",3.95,5:8783|4:11498|3:6506|2:1250|1:411|total:28448,26396,1442,2007,Ballantine Books,eng,FALSE,345494857,345494857,4128,4129,111218,111218,910444,33,345494857,9.78035E+12,Alison Weir,2006, Innocent Traitor,Innocent Traitor,eng,3.94,24976,26722,1589,384,1178,6171,10806,8183,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,4880,Innocent Traitor,345494857,"['Anne Boleyn', 'Guildford Dudley', 'Lady Jane Grey', 'Henry VIII of England', 'Mary I of England', '...more', 'Catherine Parr', 'Elizabeth I of England', 'Edward VI of England', '...less']",US$ 1.00,"['London, England', 'Sudeley, England', 'Tower of London, London, England']",,Alison Weir,50,female,"<i>Librarian Note: There is more than one author in the GoodReads database with this name.</i><br /><br />Alison Weir (born 1951) is a British writer of history books for the general public, mostly in the form of biographies about British kings and queens.

The world's largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii.<br /><br />But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta's sixty-mile main line—somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius.<br /><br />Attilius—decent, practical, and incorruptible—promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work—both natural and man-made—threatening to destroy him.<br /><br />With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.",3.81,5:7406|4:12798|3:8417|2:1846|1:383|total:30850,25391,1612,2005,Random House Trade Paperbacks,eng,FALSE,812974611,812974611,4267,4268,880,880,268880,109,812974611,9.78081E+12,Robert   Harris,2003,Pompeii,Pompeii,eng,3.79,22734,26679,1800,344,1682,7409,11015,6229,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,894,Pompeii,812974611,"['Attilius', 'Corelia', 'Ampliatus', 'Pliny']",US$ 4.04,['Pompeii'],,Robert   Harris,41,Unknown,"ROBERT HARRIS is the author of nine best-selling novels: Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, The Ghost Writer, Conspirata, The Fear Index, and An Officer and a Spy.

The stranger is a Sicilian, a victim of the island's corrupt Roman governor, Verres. The senator is Marcus Cicero -- an ambitious young lawyer and spellbinding orator, who at the age of twenty-seven is determined to attain <i>imperium</i> -- supreme power in the state. <br /><br /> Of all the great figures of the Roman world, none was more fascinating or charismatic than Cicero. And Tiro -- the inventor of shorthand and author of numerous books, including a celebrated biography of his master (which was lost in the Dark Ages) -- was always by his side. <br /><br /> Compellingly written in Tiro's voice, <i>Imperium</i> is the re-creation of his vanished masterpiece, recounting in vivid detail the story of Cicero's quest for glory, competing with some of the most powerful and intimidating figures of his -- or any other -- age: Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, and the many other powerful Romans who changed history. <br /><br /> Robert Harris, the world's master of innovative historical fiction, lures us into a violent, treacherous world of Roman politics at once exotically different from and yet startlingly similar to our own -- a world of Senate intrigue and electoral corruption, special prosecutors and political adventurism -- to describe how one clever, compassionate, devious, vulnerable man fought to reach the top.<br /><br />Page Numbers Source ISBN: 0099406314",4.08,5:7552|4:9470|3:3924|2:676|1:190|total:21812,16914,1149,2006,Simon & Schuster,en-US,FALSE,074326603X,074326603X,6445,6446,243601,243601,1237325,86,074326603X,9.78074E+12,Robert   Harris,2006,Imperium,"Imperium: A Novel of Ancient Rome (Cicero, #1)",en-US,4.05,13959,17404,1267,151,564,3292,7661,5736,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,2212,"Imperium: A Novel of Ancient Rome (Cicero, #1)",074326603X,"['Tiro', 'Marcus Tullius Cicero', 'Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus', 'Marcus Licinius Crassus', 'Julius Caesar']",US$ 3.59,"['Italy', 'Rome']",,Robert   Harris,41,Unknown,"ROBERT HARRIS is the author of nine best-selling novels: Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, The Ghost Writer, Conspirata, The Fear Index, and An Officer and a Spy.

  <blockquote>Robert Harris returns to the thrilling historical fiction he has so brilliantly made his own. This is the story of the infamous Dreyfus affair told as a chillingly dark, hard-edged novel of conspiracy and espionage.</blockquote>
</b>Paris in 1895. Alfred Dreyfus, a young Jewish officer, has just been convicted of treason, sentenced to life imprisonment at Devil’s Island, and stripped of his rank in front of a baying crowd of twenty-thousand. Among the witnesses to his humiliation is Georges Picquart, the ambitious, intellectual, recently promoted head of the counterespionage agency that “proved” Dreyfus had passed secrets to the Germans. At first, Picquart firmly believes in Dreyfus’s guilt. But it is not long after Dreyfus is delivered to his desolate prison that Picquart stumbles on information that leads him to suspect that there is still a spy at large in the French military. As evidence of the most malignant deceit mounts and spirals inexorably toward the uppermost levels of government, Picquart is compelled to question not only the case against Dreyfus but also his most deeply held beliefs about his country, and about himself. <br /><br />Bringing to life the scandal that mesmerized the world at the turn of the twentieth century, Robert Harris tells a tale of uncanny timeliness––a witch hunt, secret tribunals, out-of-control intelligence agencies, the fate of a whistle-blower--richly dramatized with the singular storytelling mastery that has marked all of his internationally best-selling novels.",4.16,5:7037|4:7782|3:2617|2:488|1:198|total:18122,11359,1482,2014,Knopf,eng,FALSE,385349580,385349580,6712,6713,18007532,18007532,24349001,54,385349580,9.78039E+12,Robert   Harris,2013,An Officer and a Spy,An Officer and a Spy,eng,4.14,9411,14413,1773,166,407,2121,6280,5439,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1378711003m/18007532.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1378711003s/18007532.jpg,2174,An Officer and a Spy,385349580,"['Alfred Dreyfus', 'Georges Picquart']",US$ 4.21,['France'],"['CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger (2014)', 'Walter Scott Prize (2014)']",Robert   Harris,41,Unknown,"ROBERT HARRIS is the author of nine best-selling novels: Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, The Ghost Writer, Conspirata, The Fear Index, and An Officer and a Spy.

Upon her arrival, she finds that her stepcousin and old friend John Comestor has disappeared, and a ghostly presence seems to have taken over his apartment in the nineteenth-century rowhouse once owned by Winnie's great-great-grandfather. Is it the spirit of this ancestor, who, family legend claims, was Charles Dickens's childhood inspiration for Ebenezer Scrooge? Could it be the ghostly remains of Jack the Ripper? Or a phantasm derived from a more arcane and insidious origin?</p><p>Winnie begins to investigate, but John's erstwhile girlfriend, Allegra, is aggressively unhelpful, and his downstairs neighbor, the cat-obsessed Mrs. Maddingly, is growing stranger by the day.

After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known today: <i>V.</i> (1963), <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> (1966), <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> (1973), <i>Vineland</i> (1990), <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i> (1997), and <i>Against the Day</i> (2006).<br /><br />Pynchon is regarded by many readers and critics as one of the finest contemporary authors. He is a MacArthur Fellow and a recipient of the National Book Award, and is regularly cited as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Both his fiction and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter, styles, and themes, including (but not limited to) the fields of history, science and mathematics. Pynchon is also known for his avoidance of personal publicity: very few photographs of him have ever been published, and rumours about his location and identity have been circulated since the 1960's.<br />",5/8/1937,Alive,17
468,Dear Life,Dear Life,,Hardcover,Alice Munro,336,"Suffused with Munro's clarity of vision and her unparalleled gift for storytelling, these tales about departures and beginnings, accidents and dangers, and outgoings and homecomings both imagined and real, paint a radiant, indelible portrait of how strange, perilous, and extraordinary ordinary life can be.<br /><br />Alice Munro's peerless ability to give us the essence of a life in often brief but always spacious and timeless stories is once again everywhere apparent in this brilliant new collection. In story after story, she illumines the moment a life is forever altered by a chance encounter or an action not taken, or by a simple twist of fate that turns a person out of his or her accustomed path and into a new way of being or thinking. A poet, finding herself in alien territory at her first literary party, is rescued by a seasoned newspaper columnist, and is soon hurtling across the continent, young child in tow, toward a hoped-for but completely unplanned meeting. A young soldier, returning to his fiancée from the Second World War, steps off the train before his stop and onto the farm of another woman, beginning a life on the move. A wealthy young woman having an affair with the married lawyer hired by her father to handle his estate comes up with a surprising way to deal with the blackmailer who finds them out. <br /><br />While most of these stories take place in Munro's home territory - the small Canadian towns around Lake Huron - the characters sometimes venture to the cities, and the book ends with four pieces set in the area where she grew up, and in the time of her own childhood: stories ""autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact."" A girl who can't sleep imagines night after wakeful night that she kills her beloved younger sister. A mother snatches up her child and runs for dear life when a crazy woman comes into her yard. <br /><br />Suffused with Munro's clarity of vision and her unparalleled gift for storytelling, these tales about departures and beginnings, accidents and dangers, and outgoings and homecomings both imagined and real, paint a radiant, indelible portrait of how strange, perilous, and extraordinary ordinary life can be.",3.75,5:6960|4:10396|3:7095|2:2270|1:764|total:27485,21521,2577,2012,Douglas Gibson Books,,FALSE,771064861,771064861,4437,4438,13530981,13530981,19092649,101,771064861,9.78077E+12,Alice Munro,2012,Dear Life,Dear Life: Stories,,3.75,19278,24061,3083,670,1984,6211,9120,6076,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333579320m/13530981.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333579320s/13530981.jpg,1648,Dear Life,771064861,,US$ 4.04,,"[""O.

476,The Terror,The Terror,,Hardcover,Dan Simmons,769,"The men on board HMS Terror have every expectation of triumph. As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition's leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape.",4.05,5:12616|4:12618|3:5757|2:1646|1:636|total:33273,27653,2919,2007,"Little, Brown and Company",eng,FALSE,316017442,316017442,4884,4885,3974,3974,3025639,16,316017442,9.78032E+12,Dan Simmons,2007,The Terror,The Terror,eng,4,21225,24226,2610,521,1324,4438,9180,8763,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,464,The Terror,316017442,,US$ 9.29,['Nunavut'],"['International Horror Guild Award for Best Novel (2008)', 'Shirley Jackson Award Nominee for Novel (Finalist) (2007)', 'British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (2008)']",Dan Simmons,189,male,"<b>Dan Simmons</b> grew up in various cities and small towns in the Midwest, including Brimfield, Illinois, which was the source of his fictional ""Elm Haven"" in 1991's SUMMER OF NIGHT and 2002's A WINTER HAUNTING.

Lawrence Wright's remarkable book is based on five years of research and hundreds of interviews that he conducted in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan, England, France, Germany, Spain, and the United States.<br /><br /><i>The Looming Tower</i> achieves an unprecedented level of intimacy and insight by telling the story through the interweaving lives of four men: the two leaders of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri; the FBI's counterterrorism chief, John O'Neill; and the former head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Turki al-Faisal.<br /><br />As these lives unfold, we see revealed: the crosscurrents of modern Islam that helped to radicalize Zawahiri and bin Laden . . . the birth of al-Qaeda and its unsteady development into an organization capable of the American embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the attack on the USS<i> Cole</i> . . . O'Neill's heroic efforts to track al-Qaeda before 9/11, and his tragic death in the World Trade towers . . . Prince Turki's transformation from bin Laden's ally to his enemy . . . the failures of the FBI, CIA, and NSA to share intelligence that might have prevented the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br /><i>The Looming Tower</i> broadens and deepens our knowledge of these signal events by taking us behind the scenes. Here is Sayyid Qutb, founder of the modern Islamist movement, lonely and despairing as he meets Western culture up close in 1940s America; the privileged childhoods of bin Laden and Zawahiri; family life in the al-Qaeda compounds of Sudan and Afghanistan; O'Neill's high-wire act in balancing his all-consuming career with his equally entangling personal life--he was living with three women, each of them unaware of the others' existence--and the nitty-gritty of turf battles among U.S. intelligence agencies.<br /><br />Brilliantly conceived and written, <i>The Looming Tower</i> draws all elements of the story into a galvanizing narrative that adds immeasurably to our understanding of how we arrived at September 11, 2001. The richness of its new information, and the depth of its perceptions, can help us deal more wisely and effectively with the continuing terrorist threat.",4.39,5:9991|4:6865|3:1842|2:241|1:76|total:19015,15641,1657,2006,Knopf Publishing Group,eng,FALSE,037541486X,037541486X,6316,6317,110890,110890,2567720,40,037541486X,9.78038E+12,Lawrence Wright,2006,The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,en-US,4.38,12737,15017,1689,60,198,1486,5496,7777,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320471617m/110890.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320471617s/110890.jpg,1934,The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,037541486X,,US$ 4.52,,"['Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction (2007)', 'J.

The stranger claims to be the child of a lost Mughal princess, the youngest sister of Akbar's grandfather Babar: Qara Koz, 'Lady Black Eyes', a great beauty believed to possess powers of enchantment and sorcery, who is taken captive first by an Uzbek warlord, then by the Shah of Persia, and finally becomes the lover of a certain Argalia, a Florentine soldier of fortune, commander of the armies of the Ottoman Sultan. When Argalia returns home with his Mughal mistress the city is mesmerized by her presence, and much trouble ensues. <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i> is the story of a woman attempting to command her own destiny in a man's world. It brings together two cities that barely know each other - the hedonistic Mughal capital, in which the brilliant emperor wrestles daily with questions of belief, desire and the treachery of sons, and the equally sensual Florentine world of powerful courtesans, humanist philosophy and inhuman torture, where Argalia's boyhood friend ""il Machia"" - Niccolo' Machiavelli - is learning, the hard way, about the true brutality of power. These two worlds, so far apart, turn out to be uncannily alike, and the enchantments of women hold sway over them both. But is Mogor's story true? And if so, then what happened to the lost princess?

508,The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,,Hardcover,Steven Pinker,802,"<b>Selected by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> as a Notable Book of the Year. </b><b> The author of <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Stuff of Thought</i> offers a controversial history of violence. </b><br /><br />Faced with the ceaseless stream of news about war, crime, and terrorism, one could easily think we live in the most violent age ever seen. Yet as New York Times bestselling author Steven Pinker shows in this startling and engaging new work, just the opposite is true: violence has been diminishing for millennia and we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species's existence. For most of history, war, slavery, infanticide, child abuse, assassinations, pogroms, gruesome punishments, deadly quarrels, and genocide were ordinary features of life. But today, Pinker shows (with the help of more than a hundred graphs and maps) all these forms of violence have dwindled and are widely condemned. How has this happened?<br /><br />This groundbreaking book continues Pinker's exploration of the essence of human nature, mixing psychology and history to provide a remarkable picture of an increasingly nonviolent world. The key, he explains, is to understand our intrinsic motives- the inner demons that incline us toward violence and the better angels that steer us away-and how changing circumstances have allowed our better angels to prevail. Exploding fatalist myths about humankind's inherent violence and the curse of modernity, this ambitious and provocative book is sure to be hotly debated in living rooms and the Pentagon alike, and will challenge and change the way we think about our society.",4.2,5:8954|4:5862|3:2478|2:749|1:450|total:18493,12557,1257,2011,Viking,eng,FALSE,670022950,670022950,7479,7480,11107244,11107244,16029496,40,670022950,9.78067E+12,Steven Pinker,2010,The Better Angels of Our Nature.

As the theme for his dissertation, he chose ""Diderot and metaphysics"". He spent three years teaching in Cherbourg and at the university of Chambéry.<br /><br />He is of Alsation extraction. Both of his parents were physical education teachers. Growing up under the influence of his parents' atheist outlook, Schmitt eventually professed himself a Christian, after years of being an agnostic.<br /><br />Initially he became known as a scriptwriter for the stage. His debut work, ""La nuit de Valognes"", was produced a number of times in 1991/1992, both in France and abroad. His breakthrough theatre work came with his second script, ""Le Visiteur"", which won Molière prizes for best author and best show in 1993.<br /><br />The following years were littered with theatrical successes such as ""Golden Joe"" (1995), ""Variations Énigmatiques"" (1996), ""Le Libertin"" (1997), ""Milarepa"" (1997), ""Frédérick ou Le Boulevard du Crime"" (1998), ""Hôtel des deux mondes"" (1999) and ""Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran"" (1999).<br /><br />Schmitt covers a variety of themes in his work. ""Golden Joe"" takes a look of the cynical attitudes to life of those involved in high finance. In ""Variations énigmatiques"", the author gives voice to two very different men, who discuss their own philosophies of life and love - as it turns out, both were in love with the same woman. ""Le Libertin"" is a historical drama about the life of philosopher Denis Diderot and a film version was released in 2000.<br /><br />In 2001, Schmitt was awarded the ""Grand Prix du théâtre de l'Académie Française"". His plays have been performed in 35 countries and translated into many languages. They show influences from Samuel Beckett, Jean Anouilh and Paul Claudel, among others.<br /><br />In addition to his plays, Schmitt has written a number of successful novels, including ""La Secte des Égoïstes"" (1994), ""Oscar et la dame rose"" (1999), ""L'Évangile selon Pilate"" (2000), ""La Part de l'Autre"" (2001), ""Lorsque j'étais une œuvre d'art"" (2002), ""L'enfant de Noé"" (2004), ""Ma vie avec Mozart"" (2005).<br /><br />World religions play an important role in Schmitt's writing. In ""Le Cycle de l'Invisible"", Schmitt attempts a harmonization of religions and cultures. ""Milarepa"" is the first issue in this series and depicts Tibetan Buddhism. The second volume, ""Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran"" is dedicated to Sufism, a subset of Islam, also referencing Judaism. ""Oscar et la dame rose"" (the third volume) concerns Christianity. ""L'enfant de Noé"" (a comparison of Judaism and Christianity) rounds off the series.<br /><br />""Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran"" (English: M. Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran) received the German prize for fiction in 2004 and a film version was produced in 2003, directed by François Dupeyron with Omar Sharif in the title role.<br /><br />Persian:<br />اریک امانوئل شمیت",3/28/1960,Alive,Unknown

For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur—offstage. <br /><br />Centerstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive.

517,Washington's Crossing,Washington's Crossing,,Hardcover,David Hackett Fischer,564,"Six months after the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution was all but lost. A powerful British force had routed the Americans at New York, occupied three colonies, and advanced within sight of Philadelphia.<br /><br />Yet, as David Hackett Fischer recounts in this riveting history, George Washington--and many other Americans--refused to let the Revolution die. On Christmas night, as a howling nor'easter struck the Delaware Valley, he led his men across the river and attacked the exhausted Hessian garrison at Trenton, killing or capturing nearly a thousand men. A second battle of Trenton followed within days. The Americans held off a counterattack by Lord Cornwallis's best troops, then were almost trapped by the British force. Under cover of night, Washington's men stole behind the enemy and struck them again, defeating a brigade at Princeton. The British were badly shaken. In twelve weeks of winter fighting, their army suffered severe damage, their hold on New Jersey was broken, and their strategy was ruined.<br /><br />Fischer's richly textured narrative reveals the crucial role of contingency in these events. We see how the campaign unfolded in a sequence of difficult choices by many actors, from generals to civilians, on both sides. While British and German forces remained rigid and hierarchical, Americans evolved an open and flexible system that was fundamental to their success. The startling success of Washington and his compatriots not only saved the faltering American Revolution, but helped to give it new meaning.<br />",4.11,5:5503|4:4036|3:2134|2:593|1:266|total:12532,11882,320,2004,"Oxford University Press, USA",eng,FALSE,195170342,195170342,8173,8174,1206073,1206073,1773948,17,195170342,195170342,David Hackett Fischer,2003,Washington's Crossing,Washington's Crossing,eng,4.11,10445,10993,339,226,493,1905,3593,4776,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353284022m/1206073.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353284022s/1206073.jpg,4116,Washington's Crossing,195170342,,US$ 4.40,,"['Pulitzer Prize for History (2005)', 'Ambassador Book Award for American Studies (2005)', 'Massachusetts Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2005)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (2004)']",David Hackett Fischer,17,male,"David Hackett Fischer is University Professor and Earl Warren Professor of History at Brandeis University.

530,Any Human Heart,Any Human Heart,,Paperback,William  Boyd,480,"Logan Gonzago Mountstuart, writer, was born in 1906, and died of a heart attack on October 5, 1991, aged 85. William Boyd's novel Any Human Heart is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling ""my personal rollercoaster""--or rather, ""not so much a rollercoaster"", but a yo-yo, ""a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child."" From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism, and abject poverty.<br /><br />Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall Any Human Heart is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. --Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk",4.27,5:6138|4:4460|3:1567|2:402|1:119|total:12686,10028,965,2004,Vintage,eng,FALSE,1400031001,1400031001,9482,9483,77866,77866,2237564,47,1400031001,9.7814E+12,William  Boyd,2002,Any Human Heart,Any Human Heart,en-GB,4.26,8365,10207,1045,94,335,1298,3615,4865,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,779,Any Human Heart,1400031001,['Logan Mountstuart'],US$ 4.77,"['London, England', 'England', 'Paris', 'New York City, New York', 'Oxford University, Oxford, England', 'France', 'Spain', 'Bahamas', 'Nigeria']","['Man Booker Prize Nominee for Longlist (2002)', 'Prix Jean-Monnet de littérature européenne du département de Charente (2003)', 'International DUBLIN Literary Award Nominee (2004)']",William  Boyd,56,male,"Note: <i>William^^Boyd</i><br /><br />Of Scottish descent, Boyd was born in Accra, Ghana on 7th March, 1952 and spent much of his early life there and in Nigeria where his mother was a teacher and his father, a doctor.

When a very local murder intersects with global forces, Jack must decide where his loyalties lie, and Madeleine will be forced to learn a lesson about the ambiguity of human morality -- one she will only begin to understand when she carries her quest for the truth, and the killer, into adulthood twenty years later.",4.09,5:4602|4:4576|3:1981|2:491|1:197|total:11847,10894,981,2004,Harper Perennial,en-US,FALSE,60586370,60586370,9515,9516,7199,7199,2547473,40,60586370,9.78006E+12,Ann-Marie MacDonald,2003,The Way the Crow Flies,The Way the Crow Flies,en-US,4.08,10227,11055,1021,184,474,1875,4317,4205,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,3981,The Way the Crow Flies,60586370,,US$ 3.62,,"['Lambda Literary Award Nominee for Lesbian Fiction (2004)', 'Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Fiction Book (2004)', 'Mikael Agricola -palkinto (2005)']",Ann-Marie MacDonald,10,female,"Ann-Marie MacDonald is a Canadian playwright, novelist, actor and broadcast journalist who lives in Toronto, Ontario.

Here Pema provides the tools to deal with the problems and difficulties that life throws our way. This wisdom is always available to us, she teaches, but we usually block it with habitual patterns rooted in fear. Beyond that fear lies a state of openheartedness and tenderness.

Without you, there is no us. It is a chilling scene, but gradually Suki Kim, too, learns the tune and, without noticing, begins to hum it. It is 2011, and all universities in North Korea have been shut down for an entire year, the students sent to construction fields - except for the 270 students at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a walled compound where portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il look on impassively from the walls of every room, and where Suki has accepted a job teaching English. Over the next six months, she will eat three meals a day with her young charges and struggle to teach them to write, all under the watchful eye of the regime. <br /><br />Life at PUST is lonely and claustrophobic, especially for Suki, whose letters are read by censors and who must hide her notes and photographs not only from her minders but from her colleagues - evangelical Christian missionaries who don't know or choose to ignore that Suki doesn't share their faith. She is mystified by how easily her students lie, unnerved by their obedience to the regime. To them, everything in North Korea is the best, the tallest, the most delicious, the envy of all nations. Still, she cannot help but love them - their boyish enthusiasm, their eagerness to please, the flashes of curiosity that have not yet been extinguished. <br /><br />As the weeks pass, she begins to hint at the existence of a world beyond their own - at such exotic activities as surfing the Internet or traveling freely and, more dangerously, at electoral democracy and other ideas forbidden in a country where defectors risk torture and execution. The students in turn offer Suki tantalizing glimpses into their lives, from their thoughts on how to impress girls to their disappointment that soccer games are only televised when the North Korean team wins. Then Kim Jong-il dies, leaving the students devastated, and leading Suki to question whether the gulf between her world and theirs can ever be bridged.<br /><br />Without You, There Is No Us offers a moving and incalculably rare glimpse of life in the world's most unknowable country, and at the privileged young men she calls ""soldiers and slaves.""",3.88,5:3474|4:5872|3:3259|2:646|1:167|total:13418,10711,1596,2014,Crown,,FALSE,307720659,307720659,9846,9847,20685373,20685373,40000267,18,307720659,9.78031E+12,Suki Kim,2014,"Without You, There Is No Us: My Time with the Sons of North Korea's Elite","Without You, There Is No Us: My Time with the Sons of North Korea's Elite",,3.85,8164,10002,1426,145,523,2526,4328,2480,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405292426m/20685373.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405292426s/20685373.jpg,2188,"Without You, There Is No Us: My Time with the Sons of North Korea's Elite",307720659,,US$ 4.23,,,Suki Kim,2,female,"Suki Kim is the author of the award-winning novel The Interpreter and the recipient of Guggenheim, Fulbright, and Open Society fellowships.
